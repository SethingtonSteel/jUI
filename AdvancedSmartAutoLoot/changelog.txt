CHANGES LISTED BELLOW THIS LINE ARE FROM MY OWN WORK

========================================
Advanced Smart Auto Loot  - version 1.0
========================================

1 - Removal of some unused variables and code blocks;

2 - Added Trash category to filters;
    	- now items categorized as trash (foul hide, daedra husks, etc) will be looted according to its own filter

3 - Added Treasure category;
        - now items categorized as treasure - yes the ones you steal to sell to a fence, you thief :') - will be looted according to its own filter

4 - Intricate and ornate items now looted independently of their type. (Also included jewelry which wasn't previously present);
    	- Previously ornate and intricate items were bound to their item type, not anymore.
    		Eg: If you had set to NEVER LOOT armor AND to ALWAYS LOOT intricate items, when you found an inticate armor piece it would not be looted,
    		now it will be looted acording only to its own filter, doesn't matter if its a weapon or armor and how weapons or armor filters are configured... 

5 - Fixed a bug where if you'd set some category filter to "Only legal", these items would never loot;

6 - Fixed some issues with Glyps filtering logic;

7 - Changed some item type filtering available options;

8 - Added the option to reset all filters to default.

[*] For the Stonethorn release, ZOS decided to change the availability (and skill order) for Rapid Maneuvers. Made necessary changes to work with Stonethorn.
[*] Had to change the filename for the dark horse dds file because ZOS would no longer access it by the old name.

[*] Occasionally, FastRide seems to become convinced that Rapids it the original skill that belongs on the bar. While I'm investigating the cause of that, I've added a slash command to allow you to force save the original skills for the front and back bars once you have manually set them to what they are supposed to be. The command is "/fastride setskills".
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]3.0 (30)[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Add a key bind to revert bar to base skill (what it was before rapids). This requires that you do not put rapids on the bar yourself, because if you do it will be saved as the original (base) bar skill. While there is nothing I can do about the constant loadscreens (especially in Cyrodiil) throwing rapids back on the bar; you can now turn it off again with a keystroke.
[*] Added detection and saving of the base skill in the bar position you have chosen for rapids. It will update when you change skills (as long as the skill that you manually change it to is NOT rapids).
[*] Revise mode transition tables.
[*] Change detection of in-combat to better schedule bar skill restores.
[*] Filter out multiple event firing to improve performance.

[*] Finally found the cause of Rapid Maneuvers sometimes getting left behind on the bar (involving bar switching in combat and groups most often). Believed to be fixed.
[*] Added an OPTIONAL dependency on LibDebugLogger to send /fastride debug messages to the LibDebugLogger instead of chat. Note that if LibDebugLogger is loaded, it will be used instead of sending messages to chat AND you must set the log level to Debug in the DebugLogViewer:LibDebugLogger settings in order to be able to see FastRide debug messages. Also, if you have LibDebugLogger, the /fastride debug command does not actually do anything anymore.

[*] Enhanced the sound selection to show you the Zenimax name of the sound that you have selected in the slide bar. (Note that some of the Zenimax sounds are so subtle that they are easily overlooked, and there are two separate "No_sound" settings though I forget what their names are.)
    As a note, you can put your mouse cursor on the sound slider in settings and then you can 
    use the mouse wheel to advance up or down the slider as you like.
[*] Finally remembered to fix the ability duration for Rapids to the full length of time that it lasts.

[*] Added in the unmorphed Destruction Staff abilities and the morphs that I forgot about.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]2.6[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Make the Destruction Staff abilities work with FastRide. "Unstable Wall of Elements", "Destructive Reach", and "Pulsar" are now recognized in their elemental variations and swapable with Rapids. This does work with the English client and should work with other language clients.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]2.5[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] In order to work around the long-lived Zenimax problem of not being able to properly execute rapid maneuvers while you are not mounted and have weapons sheathed, FastRide will now automatically bring out your weapons when you go into rapids mode while you are not mounted.
[*] Added a setting to allow you to turn off the new automatic unsheathing of weapons if you want the addon to behave the way that it used to. Automatic unsheathing is on by default.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]2.4[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Reduce / command pollution by changing some of the / commands used by FastRide (to remove them from showing up in auto-complete). The following / commands are now supported:

    /fastride - (Changed) displays the list of supported FastRide / commands in chat
    /fastride.key - (Unchanged) Toggles rapids-mode
    /fastride.settings - Open up the settings page for FastRide
    /fastride rescan - (previously /fastride.rescan) Reload skills
    /fastride reload - (previously /fastride.reload) Reload skills
    /fastride debug - (previously /fastride.debug) Toggle display of debug messages
    /fastride rapidskill - (previously /fastride.rapidskill) Display known info about rapids skill
    
    
[*] Removed direct dependency on library LibStub.
[*] Change to use standalone libraries (LibSFUtils, and LibAddonMenu) instead of bundling the libraries with FastRide.
[*] Upgrade libSFutils to version 13.
[*] Used the saved variables functions provided in libSFutils instead of reimplementing them over and over.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]2.3[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Added the option to turn off autoswitching when mounting if Rapids effect is already active. This only affects automatic switching when mounting (if you have autoswitching turned on).
[*] Removed the temporary fix now that ZOS has fixed the bug of not notifying when a player force-dismounted (by blocking, sneaking, or being pulled from your mount). The fix was included in today's patch.
Note that with the latest ZOS patch, Rapids seems less likely to get caught on the belt when entering combat - it might take some getting used to the different behaviour.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]2.2.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Fix initialization of accountWide setting to the default of true if it is missing.
[*] Upgrade libSFutils to version 10.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]2.2[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Introduce the ability to set the Rapid Manuevers skill in the case where you are running ESO in a foreign language and the addon guesses wrong about where the Rapids skill actually is in the skill tree. Because ZOS orders the skill lines alphabetically and that can obviously change where a skill line is depending on the language you are using, it is hard to guess where the Rapid Manuevers skill might be. So, if FastRide puts the wrong (non-Rapids) skill on your bar when you go into rapids-mode, then you will need to go to the addon options to pick which of the skills in the skill localization list is the real Rapid Manevers skill.
This is the proper fix to replace the previous hack for German clients which should also allow other languages to work as well.
[*]German translation for the new settings option above were translated by Google Translate. Corrections are welcomed.

[*] Added a performance improvement of the previous also suggested by kafeijao. Many thanks kafeijao!
[*] Fixed nil value error reported by cak_dk. It was caused by having rapids unlocked on a toon that had not leveled up enough to be able to weapon swap.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]2.1.3[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] Added an adaptation of code to work around the ZOS bug that was not notifying that the player dismounted when blocking, casting a skill, or attacking. The code that I adapted was provided by kafeijao for the Assisted Rapid Riding - Murkmire patch to resolve the same problem there. Many thanks kafeijao!

[*] Experimental patch to work with the German client to find the Rapid Maneuvers skill properly.
[/LIST]

[COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]2.1.1[/COLOR]
[LIST]
[*] German translation added thanks to Lupidu.
[*] Debug command /fastride.rapidskill added to display information about the rapid maneuvers ability as it is currently known and then to reload it and display the newly acquired information for the ability. Specifically provided for debugging a problem that Lupidu is having with the German client and FastRide.

[*] Prevent Rapids from replacing a skill that cannot be restored.
There are some skills which I cannot put back on the bar after they have been swapped out, because Zenimax doesn't give me the information to be able to. Those skills are primarily destruction staff skills which change names based on if you have an inferno staff verses a frost staff verses a lightning staff. There might be others that I'm not aware of but this change will consider them as well.
Now, if you put one of those skills in the slot that you have designated for rapids to be traded into, FastRide will refuse to change the skill for rapids - since it cannot restore the original skill afterwards. You will still see the gold (or purple) horse, even if the skill does not get swapped out because you are still in Rapids Mode so when you swap to your other bar, FastRide will attempt to put rapids on that bar automatically.
By default, a message will be sent to chat to inform you that FastRide could not change to rapids on the current bar, but that message can be turned off by an option in FastRide's settings.

[*] Stop walking the passives for the skill trees and the racial and crafting skill trees since those skills will never appear on a weapon bar. This should reduce startup slightly.
[*] Prepare for Murkmire.

[*]Works with Morrowind & Dragon Bones
[*]Added a rapids mode status icon that can be displayed on screen to tell you when you are in rapids mode or not. The gold horse is for rapids mode when rapids is on your belt. The dark horse is for when you are not in rapids mode. The purple horse is for when you tried to switch out of rapids mode while in combat - so it indicates that when you leave combat, rapids will be taken off of your bar.
[*]Modified so that when you morph the skill that is supposed to be on your bar but is currently replaced by rapids, the morphed skill is restored to your bar.
[*]Modified the reset on effect fade so that it only puts rapids back on the belt when the current effect fades AND you are mounted. It will not be put back on the belt automatically if you are not on your horse.

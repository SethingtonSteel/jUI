Zgoo allows you to browse through tables and userdata to example their components in a nice and easy interface.

To use Zgoo, the chat command .zgoo is used. 

/zgoo Zgoo
Will show the table for the addon.

/zgoo GuiRoot
And from there you can see all the children in the GetChildren table.

/zgoo mouse 
Will examine the element that currently has your mouse's focus.

/zgoo free
Will unlock your mouse from the reticle so you can freely move it around the screen.

/zgoo global  or  /zgoo _G
Examines the _G.

Click the [+] button to expand tables and user data. Click [.] or [:] to call functions.

Extras:
- GetChildren function added for all userdata elements. This allows for easy access and visibility to all children. (This is not available by default)
- A__Zgoo_ToggleHidden is an alias to ToggleHidden. Moved it up the list for easy access.


Zgoo Events

Track events in real time. Can unregister events by hitting the X button (reload to undo this). Hit + to expand the arguments for the event.

/zgoo events 

Known Issues:
- if some function call breaks it all, hold CTRL to disable automatic calling of Get*,Is*,Can* functions.

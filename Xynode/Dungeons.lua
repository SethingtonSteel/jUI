The 2 archers can be interrupted if they attempt to fire off their acid spray type ability and the 3 Durzogs can usually be dispatched quickly with aoe damage. Don't run away if you get agro, simply block and let the tank get the dogs off you and then focus the boss afterwards. The trash he has with him are relatively low health so although they can cause a problem to start with, they wont be there for long.\n\n|cffff00Blood Craze|r - A pretty basic physical damage attack which to a healthy tank will do minimal damage, this attack shouldn't cause much of a problem at all but if you are a dps, so long as you have a shield available or a small heal from the healer this won't be much of an issue. A very small amount of damage but be sure to note when you have it so you can get a heal if need be.\n\n|cffff00Agony|r - Very much like the Nightblade ability, this will be cast on the person with agro(usually the tank). This does a small amount of damage over time and initially stuns. So if you are caught you will have to break free, HOWEVER this ability has a cast time and CAN be interrupted. Keep your eyes peeled for this effect.\n\n\n"

They have shield charge abilities and also a Dragonknight standard which does large aoe damage. Kill these FIRST! For the tank, try to center the boss and watch out for his heavy attacks, they are slightly delayed so block EARLY to avoid getting ping ponged around the room. DPS can block this and survive also if they gain agro. do NOT run away.\n\n|cffff00Shock Assault|r - As soon as the fight is started and the boss is ready to attack he will launch off the platform at the target of his choosing (unless taunted). Upon landing he will hit with a large shock assault attack which hits the initial point and a small aoe radius around it. So when the boss jumps in, have your dps and healers spread out to avoid this impact.\n\n|cffff00Daedric Blast|r - Occasionally Ozozai will cast a red beam on a member of your group and this will start a spreading aoe effect under the player's feet. Once this reaches its peak it will explode. You have two choices, move away from your group and let it explode(while holding block) OR have the group move away from you. Which ever is easiest. Be sure to be blocking or shielding however. Anyone else caught in the explosion will of course take damage.\n\n|cffff00Staggering Roar|r - When he is low health (enraged mechanic) he will occasionally shout! Doing moderate physical damage in aoe. This can be avoided if you are a ranged dps or healer but if you are melee be sure to block or move away when this happens. This continues until he or you are dead.\n\n\n"

It is important that the tank turns the boss away from the group to avoid any frontal aoe effects hitting them. All dps and healers should be BEHIND the boss. The 2 minions should die quite fast to aoe but be sure to kill them fast, the tank has a lot of blocking to do in this fight and it is safe to not over burn his/her resources.\n\n|cffff00Pull/Chain|r - Randomly through out the fight the boss will turn on one of the group members and PULL them in to his feet, do not panic, once you are pulled simply move away back to where you were and have your tank keep agro on him. Note if you go TOO far away from the boss he will just keep pulling you in so stay fairly close.\n\n|cffff00Shocking Rake|r - This is a frontal cone shaped aoe effect aimed at whoever has the agro (hopefully the tank). It is a rapid series of hits which cause lightning damage and hit pretty hard if not blocking. Be sure that your tank is blocking this mechanic and standing STILL, do not run around because the cone will follow your position and hit the group. TIP: Don't spin the boss!\n\nThe remainder of the attacks are mostly light attacks which don't hit so hard, even a dps can take it, but you will occasionally get a heavy attack aimed at you. Be sure to block this. It isn't a one shot as such  but can  be problematic if you keep getting thrown about.\n\n\n"

Generally as with most bosses it makes sense to get your dps and healers to stand behind the boss if possible (or to the side) so that they are not in his face.\n\n|cffff00Mudcrab Swarm|r - This boss has some very basic mechanics in that he pretty much only ever really heavy attacks BUT if your group is lacking damage or specifically aoe damage his swarm mechanic can be pretty tough.\nEvery 10seconds or so (sometimes less) he will spawn around 8-10 mudcrabs. These are very small, similar to the swarms you encountered before the boss fight but of course you have those AND the boss to deal with. The simple solution to this is to have your tank put down some form of crowd control (ie talons if on a Dragonknight, grip if you are a warden etc) and then burn them down with aoe damage while focusing the boss.\nNOTE: DO NOT run away if mudcrabs are hitting you, just stay in the heals and keep doing what you are doing, running means you will make a mess of the fight and all control goes out of the window!\n\n\n"

Your group need to coordinate and your tank needs to be as still as possible.\n\n|cffff00Lunging strike|r - This is pretty much a heavy attack but it will knock the tank for miles if not blocked and if it hits a dps who does not block it WILL kill them.\n\n|cffff00Storm Flurry|r - This is a rapid striking lightning attack aimed at the tank (or whoever has agro) A very strong tank could take the full flurry but i would highly recommend blocking it, and if you are a dps definitely make sure you block it.\n\n|cffff00Horde of Mudcrabs|r - Pretty much what it says on the tin. Just like Clatterclaw he will dig into the ground and spawn mudcrabs to attack you. This is not so stressful as it is only about 3-4 crabs but they must die fast. Aoe damage on the floor under the boss while the tank pins them in place should be more than enough.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Field|r - This is the most obvious and deadly mechanic in the fight and even the most experienced players get cocky with it and die. Kra'gh will channel a spreading LARGE aoe effect on the ground and then once it reaches its peak it will explode! unless you are a tank, ANYONE caught in this, is dead. Do NOT stand in stupid! Be sure to get out as fast as possible, let it explode, then get back in again. The tank has two choices...Block it and get knocked down, or do the same as the rest of the group. Get out and get back in again.\n\nAbove all this is quite a mobile fight due to some of the mechanics so be sure to get back into position and hold that boss still as much as you can, don't let him run wild."

The tank should turn the boss away from the group and hold it as still as possible. while the group stay BEHIND it. There are two adds that should be killed fast but as long as the tank pulls them with the boss they won't last very long to standard aoe damage from the group.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - As simple as it sounds, the boss will heavy attack the person with agro, simply block this and you will be fine, even as a dps, but fail and you will be knocked down.\n\n|cffff00Spray|r - The boss will spray poison in a frontal aoe at the tank or whoever has agro, this can be interrupted.\n\n|cffff00Poison|r - The boss will select random members of the group to place poison for a few seconds under their feet. Do NOT stand in this for more than a second or so, find a gap and get safe. The easiest way to do this (incase multiple people get their own dots) is to stay together and stack up. If you stack up and poison lands, ALL together move to the next safe spot, then when it drops again, all move together and so on. You do this so that if more than one of you get a poison dot at the same time they are both placed together in one spot rather than thrown all over the room. If people start running around in circles the room will be filled and you will have no where to go, and you will die. The tank should stay still no matter what as he/she can take the damage so long as small heals are incoming.\n\n"

So many groups do NOT pass this dungeon because they cannot kill this boss. It isn't that she is particularly difficult to kill, it is more of a case of people not paying attention (or unaware) of what needs to be done. Focus, work together and pay attention to the mechanics. The tank needs to taunt the boss at all times and turn her away from the group, the group should always stand behind her and watch for her aoe attacks.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will try to almost stealth but at the same time crouch and wind up a heavy attack, you must block this or you will be knocked back and it can kill a dps/healer.\n\n|cffff00Slow One Shot|r - This is the mechanic that will destroy groups! ONE member of the group will be pinned to the floor by 4x shadows of the boss. just ONE shadow must be killed and your group member will be released. So it is essential that you as a group focus ONE SHADOW! Every time this dungeon wipes a group on this boss it is because people all try to show off killing their own shadow. kill ONE and it is problem SOLVED!\n\n|cffff00Tethered Blast|r - The boss will put a glowing affect on 2 players, and they will be tethered to each other with a beam. Spread out and run two DIFFERENT directions to break the beam, once it is gone come back in again. If you don't break the beam you will explode and die.\n\n|cffff00Shadows|r - During the fight the boss will split into 4 shadows that must be killed before she respawns again. When they are dead she will instantly come back with a heavy attack so be sure everyone is blocking in case she has lost a taunt effect and picks a dps/healer as a target.\n\n"

They are a lot simpler than they look and it is a very fast fight. The tank should ALWAYS keep a taunt on the boss (close or ranged) and NOT taunt the spiders.In the mean time the group need to focus as much single target as possible and be careful to not do too much aoe damage.\n\n|cffff00Shadow bolt|r - Randomly through out the fight the boss will Fire dark magic type projectiles at members of the group, this happens a LOT but it can be interrupted making her attacks pretty useless, keep hitting her but be sure to interrupt all the time. Be careful not to push her off the cliff bashing/interrupting though (interrupt from behind the boss not in front if you can help it. Failing this will basically make the her go to far across the room and reset the fight so be careful.\n\n|cffff00MARK/Spiders|r - Throughout the fight the boss will mark one member of the group at random. This mark affect is her telling her spiders to hit YOU. The ONLY way to agro the spiders is if YOU are the target. If you are the target, move to the other side of the room, take the spiders with you and stay alive. A tank can help you pin the spiders here also if necessary too to make them stay there longer. Everyone else should focus the boss.\n\nDO NOT!!! kill the spiders! Each spider you kill buffs her resists and if all spiders die you will ONLY do 10% damage to the boss. That's right, your 30k heavy attack now does 3k maximum...your 1k hits now do 100 etc etc. It is KEY that the spiders survive or you will be there all day!\n\n"

So only move when you HAVE TO. The tank should try to hold the boss as still as possible the whole fight and stay AWAY from the portal.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is very simple, no matter what role you are (should be on the tank) be sure to block the heavy attack or you will be knocked down.\n\n|cffff00Portal|r - The portal at the back of the room will open up and suck in a member of the group through out the fight over and over. Each time the portal pulls someone in, they will have to kill a about 7 or 8 spiders before the portal will let them leave again and come back to the fight. This happens constantly throughout the fight until the boss reaches low health. The trick to this is to be sure that a capable dps player can kill and survive in there...THIS is based on positioning so you can decide who goes in. The CLOSEST person to the portal is the one who gets sucked in. This is why it is incredibly important to fix your positions and not run headless around the room.\n\n|cffff00Burst|r - During the fight the emit a large aoe burst from her body which does high damage and knocks back if caught. Simple move away from this, the tank can block this.\n\n|cffff00Bomb|r - During the fight the boss will attach a beam to an aoe that will follow a player around the room, kite this until it explodes and then get back into position (kite = move with it to avoid it hitting you or anyone else). If it touches a player it will deal HIGH damage, and if you are caught with both this and the burst combined you WILL die.\n\n"

The adds around the room can be completely avoided if you fight the boss in the middle of the room, but if people start yoloing and running around then they will join the fight and add some complications in the form of stuns and such which you do NOT want to have to deal with, so walk in the room carefully. The tank should turn the boss away from the group and stand still. The group should stand behind the boss and also STAND STILL!\n\n|cffff00Whirlwind|r - The boss will spin his weapon around his head and anyone caught in the aoe will take high damage, simple step out of it...and i mean STEP out of it. The aoe is TINY, do NOT run around there room, there is no need, people are not impressed with you dancing, and you WILL pull the surrounding (not yet agroed) enemies into the fight.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will heavy attack the tank (or whoever has agro). This is a really hard hitting heavy attack and will knock you back possibly attracting the attention of the adds around the room. However if you block it you will take a very small amount of damage, so don't miss the block.\n\n|cffff00Drain|r - The boss raise his weapon in the air and for around 5 seconds or so, drain magicka rapidly from the whole group, this is a royal pain if you are a magicka build (does damage also) make sure through the whole fight you get in plenty of heavy attacks to keep your resources up or else you will be in trouble.\n\n"

If you focus as a group you will pass this with flying colours but you must work together. Stay together as a team. The healer should focus as much as possible to keep  the group up, the tank should shield the group if possible and ALWAYS hold a taunt.\n\n|cffff00Light attacks|r - These hit dps and healers REALLY hard so make sure that taunt doesn't drop off!\n\n|cffff00Beams|r - Periodically throughout the fight the boss will raise her staff in the air and attach a beam to each player in the group draining them of their health. This does a LOT of damage but it can be mitigated with damage shields and heals, so your healer and tank need to play full protectors during this phase.\n\nNOTE: there is a big negate bubble in the room. If you run inside this will protect you from this phase BUT you will cancel hard mode. Hard mode is achieved by NEVER standing in the bubble. No members in the group should ever go anywhere near it if you want that hard mode clear. Stay away!\n\n|cffff00Teleport and black holes|r - Every time each phase finishes the boss will teleport to 3 members of the group, one after the other. So she will jump from one to the other until she settles. Each teleport will place a black hole on the ground which will spread to a massive size and standing in it WILL kill you. This is where working as a team comes into play.\n\nIf you run around the room headless all spread out, you will fill the room with black holes and you will wipe. BUT if you stay stacked on each others feet the whole time, she will teleport to 3 of you BUT since you are all on the same spot, she will place the black holes all together. Allowing you to control where they go...\n\nThis tactic is simple. Hug up, let her place them, and them move to the other side of the room and kill her from range. Every time she teleports, do it again. Hug up move to the other side of the room. It is ranged a ranged and a long fight this way but it is incredibly effective and easy if done this way.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

It has some basical light attacks which most people should be able to survive but the dps should block if they hit them, a heavy attack that needs to be blocked and then some basic mechanics to follow through out. It is a pretty fast fight and really the tank shouldn't have too much of a problem holding the spider still while the dps stand behind it and kill it.\n\n|cffff00Summon Spiders|r - Throughout the fight Spindlekin will summon small spiders to assist it in the fight, these are the same spiders you have encountered already, low health, they spit poison in frontal aoe and ground web aoe and can feed off of dead targets. Be sure as the tank to bring these in close to or stacked onto, the main fight area, around the boss. Most aoe damage should kill these but be sure to interrupt them if they try to feed/heal.\n\n|cffff00Devour|r - Very much like the regular spiders in this dungeon Spindlekin can also devour dead enemies on the ground to heal. This is quite a substantial heal and can be a pain if the damage in your group is low and/or the team is inexperienced so to prevent this mechanic from happening you must interrupt it as soon as you see the affect happening. Basically you are looking for a visual where it appears to be 'eating' a dead spider. If you can do this, the boss won't be a problem.\n\n"

It is important that the dps and healers stand CLOSE and behind the boss. The tank needs to focus on chaining in additional spiders(or taunting from range) so the stack on the boss at the same time as making sure the boss stays as still as possible turned AWAY from the group. Note: do NOT run around the room, running will just make things messy and you will die anyway.\n\n|cffff00Summon Spider|r - Just like the last boss, this boss also summons spiders throughout the fight and these need to be taunted, and/or chained in and pinned by the tank WITHOUT making the bsos run around the room. They can be killed fast with aoe damage but be sure your group is looking out for any that try to feed/heal from dead bodies. If you catch them doing it, interrupt them. also stay out of their poison/web aoe.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Occasionally Swarm Mother will stand up on hear hind leggs and launch a powerful heavy attack at the tank or whoever has agro at the time, you MUST block this.\n\n|cffff00Leap|r - She will LEAP occasionally to a random target, hitting them hard and knocking them down. Stay together, stay close and you will be fine. HOWEVER if she does leap at you, block or dodge roll don't run away! And once it is over, get back in as close as you can. The group needs to hug up else she will keep leaving the aoe damage.\n\n"

The tank should grab the melee as soon as possible and then start to chain in the ranged targets while holding onto the boss. The dps should be able to aoe down the enemies quite quickly but should focus the healers and the mages, they hit very hard and must sometimes have their channeling abilities interrupted. Stay out of circles on the floor, fire damage in here is quite nasty.\n\n|cffff00Flurry|r - Not strictly called flurry but she does have a flurry type attack with fast light attacks aimed at the tank or whoever has agro, this isn't very strong but i would highly recommend blocking it if it is aimed at you especially since the room of damage incoming combined can be problematic.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - A straight forward heavy attack no different to any other visually, while she winds this up be sure to have your block ready. She wont kill a tank if it doesn't block but she can wipe out a weaker dps so be careful. ALWAYS block a heavy attack. Again, do NOT run away.\n\n|cffff00Immobilize|r - She casts a channeling ability and when it is complete she will stun/immobilize the target. Usually the tank, you can break free of it but you can ALSO interrupt it before it happens. Keep your eyes open and stop her from doing this.\n\n"

Firstly the tank needs to of course grab agro of the boss, you do NOT want him hitting the dps or healer. Then while agroed, try to grab as many enemies into the center of the fight as possible while keeping interrupts on the ranged and healer type enemies to prevent heals and too much incoming floor damage. For the dps keep up as much damage in AOE as possible to thin out the numbers and then eventually burn down the boss. Do NOT run around in circles, block and interrupt as and when you need to. Running will kill you.\n\n|cffff00Grip|r - Just like the dragonknight chain ability, Rabbu can also chain players in as well. He will chain and then volley with a light attack so if he pulls you in block, get out of the way and then carry on hitting him in the side/back.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - This ability is extremely easy to see and avoid but people mess it up a lot. A large strip of dangerous aoe will appear on the floor marking the path he is about to charge through. If you get caught in this you have two options, Block, or move slightly out of it. If you do not do either of the two and are not the tank, he will knock you down and kill you. Be careful!\n\n"

The room is full of enemies to start with. Be sure to pull all of the enemies into the door way making sure they are stacked up for aoe damage and the healers and ranged are interrupted. DO NOT run into the center of the room as you will pull the boss before you are ready.\nThe tank will need to position the boss where ever he/she sees fit(the middle is fine) after the enemies are all dead and stay as still as possible, turning her away from the group.\nThe dps and healer should ALWAYS stand in a triangle formation ready to pay attention to the incoming mechanics. DO NOT stack up, you MUST all have your own space else this gets very tricky.\n\n|cffff00Impale|r - Pretty standard melee attack which will only hit whoever has agro, usually the tank, this can be blocked and/or mitigated if you have lots of resists and health.\n\n|cffff00Web Pull|r - A chain like mechanic where she pulls players into the center where she is standing with a very short duration stun, this needs to be kept an eye on because when this happens she usually follows up with a 'Daedric Explosion'(coming next)\n\n|cffff00Daedric Explosion|r - This happens periodically AND after the Web Pull. This is a MASSIVE spreading aoe and once it reaches full size it explodes, you MUST spread out and avoid this else you are dead. Some tanks can stand up to it if blocking but this will knock them down. Get OUT and get back in again when it has finished.\n\n|cffff00Arachnophobia|r - This is the reason you stand in a triangle formation as dps and healers, you ALL need your own space. If she LOOKS in your direction she is firing this projectile at YOU. When this happens, dodge roll. If you timed it right you will avoid it and can carry on as normal. If not, the screen will go white, you will see hallucinations of spiders, you will be stunned for 3 seconds and be hit with a nasty web blast which will normally 'one shot' a dps or healer. Dodge roll it and get back in again, do NOT waste stamina during the fight, be sure you always have enough to dodge roll because she picks her victims randomly.\n\nTo keep this fight clean, stay in formation, dodge roll the projectile and always void the big aoe. do NOT run around the room! Good Luck!\n\n"

BUT initially there are a LOT of adds, so the tank will have to make sure these are controlled quickly and the group needs to make sure they do NOT run around the room crazy else they will disperse and it becomes a pain to pull together again. Don't run away! If you get chased by adds, bring them to the tank.\n\n|cffff00Flurry|r - The boss will hit repeatedly for a couple of seconds RAPIDLY aiming at the player with agro (this should be the tank) you must block this attack while it is channeling or you will take HIGH damage! This is also a frontal aoe so if you are a dps or healer do NOT stand in front of this or it will end for you quickly.\n\n|cffff00Jump|r - The boss will wind up a heavy attack and jump in the air at whoever has agro (should be the tank). Whoever the boss jumps at must block this! It is not a ranged jump it is literally an up and down jump at point blank range but it CAN cause problems, so stand still, block and all will be fine. Do NOT run away.\n\n"

The dps/healers should always stay behind the boss! This is a simple fight if people pay attention.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Bloodspawn will wind up a rather large heavy attack, this is very simple, keep agro on the boss and be sure to block it. If you do not block it you will take high damage and be knocked backwards. This makes the fight last longer because you will be chased by the boss and he will leave whatever ground damage is underneath him, meaning the dps have to unnecessarily reapply damage abilities that should already be doing their job.\n\n|cffff00Flurry|r - Occasionally the boss will throw out a flurry attack, this doesn't do TOO much damage to a tank, doesn't apply any knock down but can be blocked.\n\n|cffff00Slam|r - During the fight periodically the boss will slam the ground and make rocks fall from above, blocking the exits and filling from the outside in. A basic heal will keep you alive in here so focus and keep doing what you are doing. DO NOT run around the room, the rocks will one shot you. Stand still and focus. The longer the fight, each phase the room will get more and more filled with rocks until you eventually have no where to go and die.\n\n"

You will have many phases here but you MUST pay attention. Before the boss is able to be killed you must fight waves of enemies you fought in Spindleclutch I. Then the boss will transform into a wraith and the real fight begins. Do NOT run around the room, you will kill each other. The tank needs to grab each wave of enemies focusing the main boss type enemy while the group burn them down per phase, then once all are over, the tank should meet the boss and turn him away from the group...\n\n|cffff00Phase 1 Spiders|r - A large wave of small spiders, these can be killed fast with aoe as they have low health. Tank should pin these in place.\n\n|cffff00Phase 2 Swarm Mother|r - Big spider boss from Spindleclutch 1, the tank should taunt this and hold agro of the smaller spiders while the group kills it and burns the adds with aoe. Note: this boss can be repeatedly stunned.\n\n|cffff00Phase 3 Rabu and Widowmaker|r - Both mini bosses at once here. The tank needs to grab the two bosses fast and hug them up. Make sure you chain in the healers asap or the fight will last too long and the next phase will overlap. The dps need as much aoe as possible while interrupting healers and such along the way. Kill this phase fast but i would NOT recommend using ultimates at this stage, save them for the next phase.\n\n|cffff00Phase 4 Whisperer|r - The old main boss from Spindleclutch 1 , kill her fast, the tank should turn her away from the group, you are free to use ultimates here if you wish. Timing is of the essence now as the boss is about to transform and be ready to fight. If you are not fast enough you will have to deal with both. Doable, but why make it difficult right? kill her fast and then move onto the boss.\n\n|cffff00Praxin|r\n\n|cffff00Trident|r - During the fight periodically the boss cast a ground place forward moving trident type affect along the floor. If the tank has the boss faced away from the group this should only hit the tank BUT if it does aim at the group, get in the gaps to avoid it! Not avoiding it can result in a one shot.\n\n|cffff00Drain|r - The boss will occasionally curse a member of the group, when this happens their resources will be drained to all hell. Get those heavy attacks in or you will be running with zero resources!\n\n|cffff00Ring Of Death!|r - One player will be selected during the fight at random periodically. This player will have a pink ring of death placed around them and it will MOVE in a random direction. If you are inside of it, move with the circle and do NOT touch the edges...if you are OUTSIDE of the circle, do NOT TOUCH IT.\nIn stay in, out stay out! Failure to follow this simple rule will result in a guaranteed ONE SHOT!\n\n"

The tank should grab all 3 and face them away from the group while maintaining taunts on all.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - Each one of the atronachs can heavy attack, these must be blocked or things will get messy FAST!\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - If you distribute your damage evenly you CAN kill all three at exactly the same time but if not, each one that dies will enrage the remaining ones increasing the damage they put out.\nOne dying will enrage the remaining two, and another dying will further enrage the last one.\nWhen they enrage they also heal to almost 75% health.\n\nFocus as much aoe as possible as a dps while evening out single target dps per target and this should not be a problem. Their health is not that high BUT if the enemy turns on you as a dps or healer, be sure to block the heavy attacks and NOT run around the room while the tank attempts to regain agro.\n\n"

The boss has 4 spectre/ghost type archers with him. The tank should taunt the boss of course but also try to control the adds so the group can kill them. You MUST focus the adds ASAP as they deal a lot of damage and drop dragonknight standards!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack and block|r - The boss will occasionally heavy attack in the form of a backhanded shield slam. This will knock you down so whoever has agro(should be the tank) make sure you block it!\nAlso close to this phase the boss will BLOCK. DO NOT heavy attack during this phase because if you do (with melee weapons) you will bounce off his shield and go off balance and he will hit you really hard.\n\n|cffff00Blood puddle|r - The boss is a vampire and has the drain ability as expected BUT this one is a little different. The boss will sink into the ground into a blood circle/puddle and chase whoever has agro around. The fast you run the faster he gets so do NOT run. While it touches a player it will do damage and the damage done will heal the boss. As the tank or ANY player, you have two choices. Block and move slowly in a small circle (his speed will match yours and you will mitigate/avoid the damage) OR if you are a tank you can stand still and hold block. Because you are mitigating damage, he heals LESS, he heals as hard as he hits.\nWhen he comes back out of the ground he will INSTANTLY fire a heavy attack, stay blocking!\n\n"

No scroll required only a 'condition'. There are sacrifices around the room, so long as they don't die from the boss, or you don't kill any. Hard mode complete. Believe me, i have NEVER seen one die...\nThe tank should hold the boss in the middle of the room and the group should find their own individual space behind the boss away from each other by a few meters ready to avoid incoming ground aoes.\n\n|cffff00Drain|r - Pretty simple stuff, the boss will drain health from the sacrifices around the room and channel a heal from them for a few seconds. During this phase simply keep hitting him, it is only if the fight goes on too long that this heal gets stronger. Keep taunt on him and keep hitting him.\n\n|cffff00Blood circle|r - he boss will occasionally raise his hand to MID height and face the target he has selected (hence why you have your own space each) once you see who the target is you can predict the position of the incoming ground placed aoe. Once this aoe lands, step OUT of it immediately. This deals high damage but is tiny in size so avoiding it is easy, just step, don't run!\n\n|cffff00Teleport strike|r - The boss will raise his hand HIGH up and this means he is about to teleport strike. He will go from one member to the next until he has jumped to every member of the group and then reset back to where the agro comes from(should be the tank). When this happens, every group member should block until each member has been hit and then go back to normal again. It is a simple mechanic to follow, but low health players or low resists/cp players WILL die if they don't block.\n\n|cffff00Health drain|r - he boss will occasionally single target health drain the tank (or whoever has agro) this is a small damaging ability and he gains minimal health for hurting the target. This mechanic is generally not even noticed because it is so weak, at this stage so long as it is the tank being hit it wont be a problem.\n\nSimple fight, simple hard mode, stay in formation, block the bad stuff, stand OUT of stupid. Don't panic, don't run around the room and all will be fine.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

Be sure not to heavy attack the sword and board skeleton while he is blocking else he will knock you off balance, and be sure to block the heavy attacks of these particular enemies if you are the unlucky target. Get your tank to put both enemies on the boss while turning the boss away from the group.\n\nIt is KEY that the boss faces away from the group so that the Ice Tornado spell doesn't hit them.\nThe 2 adds/enemies should die to AOE (area of effect) damage while the DPS players focus down the boss.\n\n|cffff00Magic Missile|r - The Cell haunter himself will hit the tank (or whoever has agro) with a barrage of light ice attacks, usually between 2-4 in a row. After this one of two attacks will follow. These can be blocked and don't hit the tank too hard.\n\n|cffff00Health leech/Winter's Reach|r - Has a cast time and can be interrupted. If NOT interrupted in time, it will result in him casting a small ice tornado looking ability in the target's direction (hence why this must be turned away from the group, the other members can be hit too). This particular attack hits VERY hard, can almost one shot a dps character and will immobilize the target/s in ice for a few seconds (unless you break out of it).\n\n|cffff00Health leech/Drain|r - Cell Haunter's main attack and most devastating ability if not managed with blocks/shields/heals can strip a healer/dps player of their entire health bar. The boss with attach a beam of energy to its chosen target (this is random) and will drain it's life while healing itself. This ability is NOT interruptible and requires the healer to be on point and focus the victim and/or the dps player themselves to shield or heal during this phase. It is only about 3-4seconds long but the damage ticks are quite large.\n\n",

There is NO need to run. Start with him dead center of the room and your tank should hold him there at all times. He has 3 major mechanics apart from his basic light attacks on the tank.\n\n|cffff00Shadow clone|r - Shadowrend spawns a duplicate in the form of a shadow of itself, it hits for the same damage as the boss but has a TINY amount of health. Kill this as fast as possible so it doesn't become a problem and STAY CLOSE or he will jump.\n\n|cffff00Charge and devour|r - IF someone moves away from the boss (roughly more than 10meters+) Shadowrend will launch at a random target, not always the furthest away) and start chewing on his victim causing huge damage. Shadowrend has to be interupted to stop his attack. Key to this is, DON'T run, stay in the middle, then he will never do it.\n\n|cffff00Tail swipe|r - This is his strongest hit and easiest to avoid. He will do a 360 degree tail whip and anyone caught inside of the aoe will be hit hard, and knocked down. Two ways to avoid it... Step slightly out of the circle, OR block. Either works fine and while blocking the damage is minimal. Key point above all, do not run! Simple.\n\n",

You MUST get your tank to taunt/chain/pin as many as possible ESPECIALLY the ranged mage typoes. If they all focus a dps or healer they will die in a split second. So tank ALWAYS enters the room first. Pin as many targets on the boss as possible and turn her around away from the group. Burn down any enemies next to the boss with AOE damage and if you have to, focus the ranged targets and pay attention to interrupts.\n\n|cffff00Summon Clanfear|r - Every 10 seconds or so she will summon a single clanfear. They are not hard to kill but they do act as any other clan fear with nasty light attacks, a jump mechanic and tail swipe. So do not run away or it will hunt you down. Kill this as close to the boss as possible. The casting of the clanfear can be interrupted.\n\n|cffff00AOE Fire|r - Angata occasionally raises her staff and causes a small round aoe of fire on the ground, this is a very simple mechanic, just don't stand in it. Move a couple of feet out of it as it lands and you will be fine. This can be interrupted.\n\nThe rest of her attacks are mostly light flame attacks and should be manageable so long as the tank has her taunted.\n\n",

There are 4x Scamps around the room, after taunting the boss the tank should focus on pulling these in as close to the boss as possible. If this isnt possible then taunts are fine but the dps will have to focus them down. Kill them fast, watch their ground fire attacks and be sure to interrupt them if they are casting. Once they are down it is pretty smooth, just keep the boss still in the center and have everyone stay AWAY from his face. Again, don't run away if you have agro.\n\n|cffff00Summon skeletons|r - Every 10 seconds or so he will summon a set of 3x skeletons, they are relatively weak and can be killed with most aoe damage however you do want to focus these because if you don't kill them fast enough they will explode. Once they die, the timer from 10seconds starts again until the next wave.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - This is a very obvious aoe circle around his feet where he stomps the ground followed by a quick slap in the direction of his target. Simply stay out of this if you are a dps by taking a couple of steps back. If you are a tank or you get unlucky and caught in it...simply block, no running away!\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - This one is very simple and should only really be affecting the tank, stay behind the boss if you are dps or healer and occasionally the boss will do a cone type attack in the form of a Cleave at the direction of the person who he is agroing. As the tank, all you have to do here is block. IF you are unlucky enough to have it attack you and you are NOT a tank, same applies..do NOT run, just block.\n\n",

He has simple mechanics BUT he hits like a steam train! The easiest position for tanking him to start with is in the furthest corner of the room, this means the feasts that heal him have further to go and are easier to manage. His attacks are somewhat random timing wise but there is a window where you must pay close attention to avoid an almost guaranteed one shot. The tank should be able to tank him MOSTLY on the spot but be aware if you do move the boss be sure to keep him in any friendly aoe damage so he can continue to loose health. Running around the room will NOT help.\n\n|cffff00Feasts|r - Every few seconds a feast (healing orb) will spawn where the boss first started. They will float slowly to him no matter where he is and you must kill these as fast as possible. Do NOT let them reach him else he will heal for massive amounts of health. He has 5million health to start with on hard mode, make sure he doesn't heal.\n\n|cffff00Ghost fire|r - This ability is a barrage of nasty ground based fire aoes. He will raise his sword and place 4 pools on the ground one after another. Simply move out of them and watch your feet. Do not run away from the boss fight as such, just move a couple of feet at a time, or dodge roll to get out of the fire.\n\n|cffff00Heavy blow|r - This is his heavy attack. Simple heavy attack indicator like any enemy in the game for this one (white/yellowy flash from his body) be sure as the tank to BLOCK THIS. If you do not it will hurt a HUGE amount and if a dps gets hit with this without blocking, it is a one shot guaranteed. It hits INCREDIBLY hard. If you are a dps and it is coming for you, be sure to block it. If you are max health you will just about survive it, if not, you are dead.\n\n|cffff00Magic bolt|r - This fireball type ability is possibly his most dangerous mechanic aside form the heavy attack because it is powerful, fast, and very hard to avoid. After he does his Ghost fire or heavy attack he will RANDOMLY select a player to throw a magic bolt at. If you don't have solid resists, a damage shield or enough health in your bar this will almost guarantee a one shot to a dps or healer. SO you MUST block or dodge roll this mechanic. The safest way to stay alive is each time you see him raise his sword (Ghost fire Mechanic) OR heavy attack (Heavy Blow mechanic) hold block until you see him do the Magic Bolt (like a fire ball). Be aware however if the Ghost Fire ability has been cast you will still have to step out of the fire, while being ready to block. Avoiding this mechanic is the difference between a wipe and a pass because if people die this is VERY hard to recovery from.\n\n",

She has two flame atronachs which will need to be dealt with quickly or else they will cause a problem. The tank should grab the two adds and the boss and turn all 3 away from the group. Aoe damage should be enough to KILL the atronachs but when they die, do NOT stand in their place because they explode. Then it is about dealing with the boss.\n\n|cffff00Flame aoe|r - Occasionally through out the fight she will cast her staff into the air and throw a mortar type effect out which will explode on the floor, this then leaves a small flame aoe on the ground usually in the direction of the tank (or whoever has agro) as a dps/healer avoid this at all costs because it REALLY hurts.\n\n|cffff00Flame wheel|r - This mechanic you may have seen before in blessed crucible and i like to call it 'the wheel'.\nThe boss will crouch and start channeling and during this time she will cast flames across the floor repeatedly in a kind of birds eye view wagon wheel type shape/effect. You MUST avoid this, it will one shot a dps or healer so your foot work is key here. As soon as you see her crouching, move back as far as you can and when the flames come to you, simply move side to side to avoid it.\n\n"

(sorry stream joke, you will have to watch to catch up). This boss is ultra awesome but also SO dangerous to people who run around in circles. This boss fight requires you to FOCUS. Hold the boss still, as the tank and stand behind the boss as a dps and/or healer.\n\n|cffff00Flame Breath|r - The flame breath is a large cone affect in the form of a flame thrower/breath! This will be aimed at a random player so when this happens, simply stand OUT of it until it is over.\n\n|cffff00Bite (flames of death!)|r - The boss will bite the person with agro and then stun them to the ground, when this happens they will be affected with a fire damage over time affect. This DOT will drop a fire on the ground in a small circle every 2 seconds until the dot has gone...BUT this dot will never leave the ground until the boss is dead...THIS means that if you move around the room you will constantly place fire all over the floor and the room will be eventually filled with fire!\n\nThe trick to this is for your tank to 'grow a pair!'... basically stand still, hold the boss for as long as you can in one spot while taking heals. This will of course mean that each fire drop will increase the damage you tank, but try to stand still as long as you possibly can before you HAVE to move. If you doo have to move because it gets too much , simple move to the side slight and start dropping a new aoe in an empty space and your stand still phase basically starts again. DO NOT! run around the room!\n\n|cffff00Swipe|r - This is a basic attack, the boss will hit you the person with agro for moderate damage usually after the bite. Blocking will prevent this from dealing a lot of damage and isn't really that much to deal with.\n\n"

The tank should turn the boss away from the group and hold on to the two adds while the group burn the adds with aoe damage.\n\n|cffff00Whirlwind|r - Every so often the boss will spin his weapon around his head in a small aoe damaging people inside of the circle. This is a very simple mechanic, stand out of it and you will not be harmed.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The simplest mechanic in the game for a tank to put into practice...This heavy attack requires you to BLOCK. If you do not block you are dead! The wind up to this heavy attack can actually hit JUST before the attack connects so be sure to look out for this and block early.\nA tank, dps or healer can block this and it will do hardly any damage what so ever, but if you fail to block it is a guaranteed one shot!

Running around in circles will kill you! The tank should hold the boss as still as possible while the group apply their damage/heals. There are 3 important phased to keep an eye on as well as killing the boss.\n\n|cffff00Blue Balls and Burst|r - Every few seconds the boss will jump into a blue orb and disappear, during this phase one of the 3 add phases will spawn (explained below) and she will after a few seconds come back out again. Every time this happens 2 new orbs appear in the room which you must avoid! The jump around and they do a lot of damage, so watch your feet. Do not run away as such, just be careful where you stand. Each time she comes out of the ball/portal she will do a LARGE spreading burst aoe affect that you must either step out of or BLOCK to avoid as much damage as possible.\n\n|cffff00Phase 1 banekin|r - A small spawn of Banekins will come out of the portal/ball as the boss jumps inside of it, these MUST be killed fast and controlled before she comes out again else you will have to deal with them while she is in the room.\n\n|cffff00Phase 2 Twighlights|r - A small spawn of Twightlights (x4) will come out of the portal/ball as the boss jumps inside of it, these MUST be killed fast and controlled before she comes out again else you will have to deal with them while she is in the room.\n\n|cffff00Phase 3 Clanfears|r - A small spawn of 3 Clanfears will come out of the portal/ball as the boss jumps inside of it, these MUST be killed fast and controlled before she comes out again else you will have to deal with them while she is in the room. These jump, stun, knockdown and all sorts so they MUST be killed fast, be sure to save your ultimates for this phase.\n\nNote each phase you do not successfully kill will stay with you per phase until they are dead.

The tank should keep both bosses taunted at all times and face them away from the group. There is a trick to taunting these effectively however. They are both ranged so will NOT move to the tank. So you you taunt the furthest away boss, and run into the corner, it will come closer (infact on top almost of the other boss) Once she is there, come back in again and hold them both together. ALWAYS facing the tank NOT the group.\n\n|cffff00Feasts|r - Every few seconds a feast (healing orb) will spawn (4x) kill these before they reach the boss and they will not heal.\n\n|cffff00Damage shields|r - Every few seconds one boss will shield the other with a damage shield. This is your opportunity to focus the OTHER boss rather than the one with the shield. Always hit the weaker one while doing aoe damage to both.\n\n|cffff00Frontal aoe|r - The bosses will channel an affect which will force a frontal aoe and knock back to whoever is hit, be sure to interrupt this to avoid the mechanic from happening. This can happen sometimes as fast as every 5 seconds.\n\n"

Rilis is no longe melee, he is ranged, which means taunting him and keeping him in one place(especially since he teleports too) makes this pretty difficult. There are many complex mechanics that need to be executed/understood in order to complete this challenge.\n\n|cffff00Feasts/Deadroths (Jeffs)|r - Every 45 seconds One Deardroth and two Feasts will spawn from the bosses starting point. The feast MUST be killed fast else if they reach the boss they will heal him a STUPID amount! The Deadroths on the other hand, fire projectile flames that knock back members of the group and then place a flame aoe on the ground. If this hits you, break free fast, failing that you can block or dodge roll it if you see it coming. The tank needs to hold the Deadroths at all times. Also they have flame breaths and a stomp ability which can be and SHOULD be interrupted.\n\nYOU CAN kill them, but if you want hardmode to be completed, you will need to have 3 alive, when Rilis dies. So you can do one of two things. Let the tank hold the them at the stairs, while keeping a taunt on the boss and be sure you don't over burn him before 3 come out....failing that you can kill every single one of them until the boss is low health...Then, STOP damage on the boss, until 3 Deadroths are out...then finish him:)\n\n|cffff00Bubbles!|r - here are two runes on the ground, one side of the room is red the other side is blue. When Rilis puts you in a levitation bubble, pay attention to the colour of it...when you land you are cursed and will take LOTS of damage, as well as being snared. You need to get to the matching coloured rune as fast as possible to remove the curse.\n\n|cffff00Flames|r - When the boss raises his staff he will select members of the group to cast flame ground based aoes at. If you stand still these will kill you, so be sure to move around in a circle to place these on the ground until he has finished if you are the target.\n\n|cffff00Lightning attack|r - IF you have agro on the boss, you will recieve multiple light attacks from his shock staff, and this happens every couple of seconds. To dps this will kill you in a bout 3 hits, the tank MUST taunt the boss so this hits him/her instead. Note: absorb magicka skill does make this do nothing to the tank and instead heal from it.\n\n|cffff00Teleport|r - Roughly every 30seconds Rilis will teleport to a new location, so time your ultimates. Don't have him stand in one place for 20seconds or so and THEN decide to drop them. Wait until he moves and use them when he is in his NEW location to make the most them.\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\n"

The heals are incredibly strong and to a group with low damage who forget to interrupt her, this can be a pain.\n\n|cffff00Fireball|r - This is a pretty basic attack but it does have a splash/spread affect to it, so try not to stack up to much and stay out of the bad stuff when it lands. Apart from that her basic flame attacks especially while the tank has proper agro, is a minor issue and really doesn't hurt that much at all. However if you do get caught, i would suggest you shield/block as and when and just watch where you stand.\n\n|cffff00Healing|r - This boss heals more than she does attacks!\nShe has two major heals, one which will heal someone else and one which will heal herself. The single target one resembles that of traditional targets with a stream like affect and CAN be interrupted. Make sure you stay on top of this in order to prevent her healing her allies.\nThe other heal is very similar to that of the templar healing skill line. She animates into a short duration prayer state and when it has finished channeling she receives a HUGE heal (also ticks over time). you MUST interrupt this else this will cause some big problems to groups with lower damage than most. The way to pass this boss, is to STOP her from healing.\n\n"

It is a fairly mobile fight and people need to be on their toes, while dealing with places and cast AOEs as well as multiple waves of adds depending on how fast you dispatch the boss!\n\n|cffff00Move|r - As simple as it says on the tin. Periodically the boss will stop what he is doing and then run to another location and start attacking form there instead. This is every few seconds and his initial movement is triggered once the first player gets too close. He moves every 10-12 seconds roughly and spawns anything UP TO 6 kwamas. They all have very low health and can die fast to general AOE damage but make sure your tank controls them.\n\n|cffff00Burst|r - When he is about to run each time, he will cast a spreading AOE shock blast, if you are caught in this you will take a LOT of damage so logic plays a roll in this one. When you see that mechanic, move OUT of it and let him reposition himself.\n\n|cffff00Poison Vials|r - Occasionally throughout the fight he will throw poison vials onto the floor aiming at whoever he sees fit at the time. These do nasty AOE damage to whoever is caught in them ticking over like a poison dot until you leave the area, do NOT get caught by these and if you do, get out of them as soon as you can. A tank will be able to stand in them although there is no need, but a dps or a healer unless healing a LOT will die in only a few ticks.\n\n"

The basic rule for this boss is to KEEP HIM STILL, but time and time again you will see people running around the room. That is NOT the way to do it. Hold him still, get everyone in close and watch your feet!\n\n|cffff00Lunge|r - A very simple RULE rather than mechanic. This is used in many situations and on many bosses throughout the game but people fail on this mechanic the most...\n'Don't run away!'IF you run away from the boss rather than standing about 5-10meters away he will jump on your head! Simple...stay close and he won't do it!\n\n|cffff00Spawn Kwama|r - A very small AOE effect will appear at the bosses feet and he appears to be digging into the ground. Get out of the affect (it snares and hurts) then 3x kwama will spawn. They are very weak and can be killed fast with AOE. Your tank should control them and NO ONE should be running away.\n\n|cffff00Slam|r - A small cone attack slam, in the direction of the tank or whoever has agro. This is avoidable and blockable so be sure to block if it is aimed at you. It doesn't hit too hard though.\n\n|cffff00Ground Pound|r - The most dangerous, scary looking and EASY mechanic to this boss. He pounds the ground like mad repeatedly hurting everyone inside the massive AOE every time he hits the ground until he stops. There is one way to avoid the entire mechanic. BASH/INTERRUPT him and he WILL stop.\nFor the last time, do NOT run away, he will jump!\n\n"

A big squid looking netch with bad breath basically. He will always attack whoever has agro so your tank should simply hold him still on the spot while your dps and healers stay behind him spread out.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - As simple as it sounds, the boss has a heavy attack. Whoever has the agro (should be the tank) simply block it. It barely scratches and you don't need to run around the room like a maniac, relax.\n\n|cffff00Poison|r - This ability is pretty huge, covers the real-estate of the boss roughly and does quite a bit of poison damage over time if you are caught in it, BUT it is placed on the ground so very easy to avoid. All you have to do is step out of it and you are safe. Again no running around the room, there is no need.\nThis is also interruptible if you are fast.\n\n"

He is small, has a few adds around him which the tank NEEDS to pick up fast before they overwhelm the group and above all keep this guy as still as you possibly can. If he gets loose it is all over. I highly recommend you spread your healer and dps out a bit so you don't all get hit by the same thing at once.\n\n|cffff00Dart|r - A really nasty long ranged heavy attack which must be blocked. This should only hit the tank but if the taunt is dropped or you don't have one you MUST block this.\n\n|cffff00Slam/Jump|r - Occasionally the boss will jump up in the air and quickly slam back down again onto the ground. A small AOE will visually show its range but you do NOT want to get caught in this. A tank can withstand the blast and should block but a dps will be lucky to live through it in most cases.\n\n|cffff00Steam Attack|r - Occasionally the boss will charge up a kind of swirling steam attack in the direction he chooses, this is devastating to a dps so avoid it at all costs BUT this can be interrupted. You are looking for a small round AOE affect on the floor moving in a straight line. DON'T get hit!\n\n|cffff00Spin|r - This is the one the tank needs to control. Keep your stamina up because you will need to block this. The boss will go into a craze and spin for a few seconds, each tick of damage will hit anyone in the area and he will home in on the agroed target. The tank needs to keep the boss still and either BLOCK the damage. If this catches a dps, they will die. If unfortunately you have no choice and it is chasing a dps or a healer, then the chosen target should kite around the boss in a small circle avoiding the aoe until he has finished and settled down again.\n\n"

He has 3 basic mechanics which are VERY easy to determine which is which because they are colour coded by the lights on his body. The tank should keep this boss as central to the room as possible at all times and pay close attention to the colour changing. The group needs to pay close attention to the changes of the bosses routine and be sure to NOT sprint around headless...speaking of which, on to the mechanics!\n\n|cffff00Decapitate|r - This is the mechanic that happens when the boss is YELLOW... While he is yellow he will aim at the tank (or whoever has agro) and will do 3 heavy attacks about 2seconds or so apart from each other. These heavy attacks have a cone affect on them too so ANYONE caught in it will get hit. The tank MUST block or it is dead. and any dps caught by this will die too so do NOT spin the boss. You can dodge roll  backwards if you really really must but do NOT spin him. Try to keep him still, and if you are a dps or healer do NOT stand in front of the boss.\n\n|cffff00Lightning|r - This phase happens when he is blue. He will raise his arm and fire shots into the air. These will land on a chose players head and the way to avoid the damage is to very simple, keep close to the boss while keeping up your damage/heals etc and circle him slowly moving out of the way of each falling meteor type shock pool.\n\n|cffff00The Spin!|r - This is the big one and destroys PUGs. When he turns RED, he will choose a target. The tank if you are lucky, but 9 times out of 10 it is someone else. You need to understand how to handle this. He will spin like made doing physical damage every tick in side the AOE of the spin and SLOW you down with a snare. So if you get hit once you are pretty much dead and he cannot be taunted. The trick to this is to keep moving...\n\nHOW you move however makes a big difference. You need to co-ordinate.\n\nWhoever has his attention needs to move in a reasonable sized circle to keep him off them BUT, try to gauge it so that the circle makes him deliberately stay INSIDE the damage already placed on the ground by your group. You can move around in a 15-20meter circle at most and still make him take tons of damage. BUT as soon as you start running around like a headless chicken, damage wont be applied and the fight will last way too long. Also another thing to pay full attention too. DON'T yolo into your team mates. They will die getting caught by it. Relax, go around in a nice circle and keep him in the damage until he has finished, then let the tank take him back\n\n|cffff00Spiders|r - At 25% and under he will spawn dwemer spiders in the room. They are usually pretty spread out, and they just sit in little green circles. IF he touches the circles he will heal, IF he does not, he wont. So your call. Kill them if you want, or simply keep him away from them. They are not a real threat.\n\n"

The tank should position the boss in the center of the room and hold the agro while also pulling in as many of the adds as possible. There are lots of enemies to deal with and general aoe should be able to kill these fast, but people must stay on top of interrupts if archers try to channel abilities.\n\n|cffff00Fireball|r - A simple basic attack which should only really be directed at the tank. Blocking will prevent this from being any real threat but to be honest the damage is so low that any healer or even a vigor will keep this from doing any serious damage to a tank.\n\n|cffff00Spinning Flames|r - This mechanic is extremely obvious but people get the false 'i am god mode' feeling and seem to think they can stand in this, you CANNOT!\nThe boss will raise his staff in the air and spin a flame ability slowly around his head in 360degrees. You have two options, follow it round from behind or stay ahead of it in front and just circle the boss. So long as it doesn't touch you, you are fine. Focus, pay attention to it and get caught.

DPS and healers should NOT stand in the bosses face. In the mean time the tank should also control the 2 scribs that spawn with the boss. These can be tricky.\n\n|cffff00Scrib stuns|r - The Scribs can fire off heavy attacks which must be blocked but above all they do channel abilities but due to the red colour of the room it can be very hard to see it happening. Keep your eyes peeled, if you do NOT interrupt the scribs they will pin players to the ground and drown their resources. This is unbreakable too so you will literally have to go through the motions while being hit. Interrupting these is KEY, not killing them. Killing them just makes them respawn.\n\n|cffff00Slam|r - The boss will occasionally slam the ground doing moderate aoe damage, heals should keep this from being a problem, it is not a one shot mechanic. However the tank should keep a taunt up as much as possible.\n\n|cffff00Slam and damage shield|r - At low health the boss will enrage, gain a damage shield and violently slam the floor repeatedly. This will continue to happen UNTIL you do enough damage to take his damage shield away. Your healer really needs to be on point here because in a low dps group although this is completely doable, the longer the shield is up, the longer people have to be kept alive for. Do not try to run away, it will NOT save you. focus that damage shield and get it down!\n\n"

The tank must taunt all 3 of them and face them away from the group else they will get loose and start causing problems. Do not run away from these if they get loose they MUST stay together.\n\n|cffff00Jump|r - Just like regular Alits, these jump in the air and slam back down again in the form of a heavy attack. If you are the tank of course you should block this to prevent knock down. If you are a dps or a healer and for some reason they are hitting you, the same applies...make sure you block.\n\n|cffff00Breath|r - A very small AOE effect will appear at the bosses feet and this will be aimed at whoever has agro. Again this should be on the tank and people should not be standing in front of the bosses, they are turned away from the group for a reason.\n\n|cffff00Revive!|r - The damage on these enemies must be EVEN. Do not over burn one target. When an Alit dies, after a few seconds if the rest are not dead they will Revive with around 25%ish health. If another dies and the rest do not, then it will get back up, if TWO die and the last one does not, the other TWO will get back up...I Think you can see where i am going with this. Kill them all together if you can to prevent constantly fighting the endless revive mechanic. Pace your single target per boss and keep up an even amount of aoe.\n\n"

The trick to this one is knowing WHAT to kill and WHEN.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Shield|r - This boss while floating around has a lightning shield surrounding it...do NOT attack the boss. ALL projectile damage will be reflected at the caster! The tank can taunt the boss since that is not reflected but the negative effects can be. So be careful. All damage will only hit Grobull for 10% if not reflected so don't waste your time hitting him. You can ONLY hit him properly during a certain mechanic..\n\n|cffff00Charge attack|r - The boss will try to charge/shock players which will stun them in mid air, you MUST break free from this.\n\n|cffff00Ground lightning|r - This very easy to spot large circle of lightning MUST be avoided, you can be slowed, stunned and killed inside of it, avoid it at all costs.\n\n|cffff00Netch Swarms|r - MANY small Netch swarms will come into the room, the tank should try to pin these as much as possible in a little cluster while the group throws down as much AOE as possible. You will have to move a lot to avoid the boss but stay together. Spreading out and running around headless will wipe you.\nLarger Netch types MUST be taunted by the boss because they do nasty heavy attacks and will need to be controlled. Anyone who gets heavy attacked MUST block!\n\nEach killed add will hit the boss with a charged ability and once the boss has been hit by enough dead charges he will sit down for 10seconds, and THIS is your opportunity to damage the boss as much as possible!

A MASSIVE army of mechs sitting outside the door to the last boss! The tank and healer are under HIGH pressure on this particular encounter. Be aware of your surroundings, taunts and cc must be applied to pin and/or chain in the ranged targets and the group must NOT run around the room. Running will prevent you from getting heals and also make you pull increased amounts of enemies. Position your group in a safe place away from the army, once you have agroed one of them from range, they will steadily come to you in waves. Fast but controlled. If however you go too close you will pull them all at once and it is game over. FOCUS!\n\n|cffff00Spheres|r - Ranged targets with nasty ground aoes and darts that fire at the group. The tank needs to pull these in and pin them as fast as possible so they don't pick off the dps\n\n|cffff00Spiders|r - These are close ranged and can be controlled easily but they must die fast. These will charge up a lightning bubble and all mech army enemies can run over to these and charge themselves with lightning increasing their damage output. Do not let them do it!\n\n|cffff00Centurions|r - The BIG ones, these are easy to spot and they are easy to get taunts on but these must be grabbed fast, they can almost one shot a squishy dps and can cause wipes. The tank should ALWAYS make sure these are turned away from the group. If you are a dps/healer and these are on you, make sure you block until they are controlled.\n\nAbove all do NOT run around the room, focus, and use as much AOE as possible.\n\n"

This has simple mechanics but can go SO SO wrong. Your tank in this fight, plays debuffer, controller and protector! The boss cannot strictly be taunted and will run around the room in a circle in the direction of it's choice. BUT you can still apply a taunt to debuff it with major fracture and breach to increase the damage done by your team. This boss moves all of the time apart from when it changes phases so your damage needs to be carefully applied. Don't waste ultimates unless he is sitting down and/or adds are present because he will just walk out of them. Time everything!\nEvery few seconds while walking around the boss will sit down and change phases RANDOMLY, you need to recognize fast which phase is which. There are 3!\n\n|cffff00Phase 1 Poison|r - A very simple, the room goes green and everyone takes damage constantly (healers and shields from the tanks will help and are essential. During this phase as well as survival being key you can get VERY close to the boss if you are doing damage and you will not be hit with any additional damage. Just the aoe poison. Keep the heals coming\n\n|cffff00Phase 2 Fire!|r - The boss will spin his head while walking emitting a HUGE flame thrower in 360 degrees, do NOT go anywhere near him, stay ranged and do what you can. In the mean time he will fire mortar shots at the ground and they will explode in large circle aoes of fire. stay OUT of them.\nNOTE when he sits down AFTER the fire it is NOT safe. No matter what phase is next, he will still do one more final flame thrower spin, stay away until it is actually gone.\n\n|cffff00?Phase 3 Lightning + Spheres|r - This phase the boss will zap anyone close by so do NOT stay near him else you will die fast, you can dodgeroll under him and miss damage but staying close long term will kill you, so again ranged damage only. Also during this phase 3x spheres will appear and these MUST be killed. The tank needs to chain/pull them together and pin them down while the group kills them fast. free free to nuke these with ultimates. If you do NOT focus these you will get overwhelmed and it is possible to end up getting 2/3/4 phases of lightning in a row meaning you could get WAY more than 3 adds at once. FOCUS the adds. If the tank has not applied a taunt on each one yet keep your eyes open, they do have interruptible mechanics to prevent them from throwing ground aoe effects and also they do heavy attack with darts, if you see this, BLOCK!\n\nAll of the phases are random, they can go in order , they can be random, they can duplicate, it is not predictable. Learn how to manage each phase and you will be fine. Also note, hard mode is basically doing the above. If you persist you will complete it and hard mode will be done...HOWEVER there are 4x levers in the middle of the room, if you activate these during the poison phase it will negate the poison completely BUT this will cancel out hardmode completion. So be very clear that you group do NOT press any buttons and the achievement is yours!\n\nGood luck!!\n\n"

So long as the tank can block when required to, hold a taunt and keep the boss facing AWAY from the group, everything should be fine. Healers and dps should stand behind the boss at all times and stay close. DO NOT run around the room like a headless chicken it will not help.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - She will cleave in a frontal AOE in the shape of a cone, the tank should block this and hold her still making sure she does NOT face the group with this attack. It knocks back and can make things messy.\n\n|cffff00Whirlwind|r - Occasionally the boss will spin her weapon around her head making a whirlwind like AOE and anyone caught in this small damage circle will take damage per tick. Simply stay out of the circle and everything will be fine. No need for sprinting around, just get your feet out of it. The tank can stand in it if blocking but there is really no need, simply hold a taunt and keep her still. This ability by the way is usually followed by a heavy attack/uppercut which can and SHOULD be blocked.\n\n|cffff00Jump|r - IF you decide to start running around the room for no good reason, once someone gets too far from her she will randomly JUMP at players and land on their head. Do not run around, stay close to her and this mechanic will never happen. It is designed to keep up group co-ordination, and messy groups will have a problem with her.\n\n"

There are a few basic light attacks that they attempt to pull off and the odd heal which can be interrupted, however these can be killed VERY fast with even the lowest AOE damage.\n\n|cffff00HEAL|r - She will occasionally try to heal her self or her minions (if they last that long) and this is a channeled effect which is easily spotted by her raising her hands and can be interrupted to prevent her from doing so.\n\nApart from the above she has very weak light attacks, should be turned away from the group and burnt down on the spot. Some of the trash enemies can be considered harder than this boss...Until Elden Hollow II that is when we meet the darker version of her!\n\n"

The tank should be taunting the boss at all times and turn the boss away from the group. The group should then circle fairly spread neatly around the boss but CLOSE to it. The tank needs to make sure that he/she blocks the heavy attacks which come occasionally during the fight to avoid being knocked down.\n\n|cffff00Vine pull|r - This Mechanic is very simple, IF you are too far away from the boss, it will chain you in and you are somewhat stuck for a second or so, this does minimal damage but is a pain and should be avoid if possible. This followed by the burst AOE mechanic can be a problem so do NOT run around the room, stay close unless mechanics mean you have to move.\n\n|cffff00Burst|r - very few seconds Chorkthorn will bury his head in the ground and a very large AOE will spread from the center of the room. This is your time to pay attention and get OUT of it. As soon as it is over, get back in close again. This is a very high damage ability and to a NON blocking NON shielded dps or healer, this will take around 90% of your max health from you and if unlucky can one shot people as well.\nSimple mechanics, get out when it spreads, get back in when it is gone. If you are a tank caught in this, there is a low chance of dying but it WILL knock you down.\n\n|cffff00Healing Stranglers|r - Throughout the fight small stranglers will spawn around the room and attach a healing beam to the boss, healing for small amounts. These can be either interrupted or killed, but be sure to get back in position once you kill one to prevent the boss pulling you in with vines. With a LOW dps group if you don't kill them or stay on interrupts then you can get overwhelmed with these and it becomes very hard to kill the boss due to the amount of stacking heals. So be sure to prioritize these targets.\n\n"

The tank should look for this guy first off and hold him on the spot facing away from the group. Then while holding the boss, try to pull in as many of the others as possible on top of him in order for the group to AOE damage the adds. DO NOT run around the room, let the tank control the targets before they get out of hand.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - A simple uppercut which should be blocked or else you will get knocked down. This is fine for even a dps to block as it does barely any damage.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Form|r - Just like the sorcerer player ability, he is in the form of lightning and standing too close to him will zap players every second with shock damage, but the damage is VERY small. This shouldn't cause much of a problem.\n\n|cffff00Burst/mages fury|r - This is a channeled attack which bursts lightning once in a small AOE. It does minimal damage BUT it can be interrupted. So if the team is on point with interrupts, this mechanic will not be a problem at all.\n\n"

A big dinosaur looking boss with some very simple mechanics. He has one friend with him and the tank should taunt both the regular Alit and the boss and simply hold them together facing away from the group. The group should stay behind the boss at all times.\n\n|cffff00Bite|r - An extremely weak attack which the tank can withstand without even blocking however can be problematic if too many hit a dps or healer, keep the boss turned away from the group and on the tank to prevent anyone from being bitten.\n\n|cffff00Jump|r - Just like the other enemies of this kind, he will JUMP in the air and slam onto the target he has agro too (hopefully the tank). This is basically his heavy attack and MUST be blocked. A tank, dps or healer will live through this with a simple block BUT if not blocked it can do quite a lot of damage and knock down. Be sure the tank is taunting and blocking during this mechanic to save any issues. IF the boss is loose on a dps or healer however they should BLOCK and NOT run around the room. No need to run.\n\n|cffff00Breath and bite|r - This is a breathe IN animation followed by a pretty nasty bite. This should be kept facing the tank, do NOT spin the boss around because it is a cone shaped AOE and can hit more than one person. This can be blocked but also, while it is casting you can actually just step out of it and then once it is over, step back in again.\n\n"

She has a lot of health and does a LOT of damage if people don't pay attention. She can be taunted and held on the spot but a lot of mechanics will individually target other members of the group so co-ordination is key. You tank should hold the boss in the center of the room and your remaining group members should stand in a triangle formation having their OWN space just like in Spindleclucth fighting the whisperer. Do NOT run around the room. Find your spot and only move from it when you HAVE to.\n\n|cffff00Frost|r - Very much like lightning form (but without the visual) she will spawn a frost ability which will do very small damage over time to people very close to her, this is weak but indicates her next mechanic is coming (the poison bolt).\n\n|cffff00Poison Bolt|r - This s the reason you must stay in formation. Although the tank can hold a taunt on her for the whole fight, THIS mechanic is random and she will cast it on whoever she wants. She will physically turn and face the target she has chosen, wind up a channeled ability and fire a poison bolt at the player. If this is YOU, you NEED to dodge roll as she casts it. Doing so will mean you completely avoid the damage. BUT if you miss time it you will be hit with the bolt and take a LOT of damage along side having a small damage over time on you also. This can kill most dps/healer types if they are not paying attention.\n\nOnce you have dodged the mechanic, get back in position ASAP. Don't sprint around the room.\n\n|cffff00Stun|r - This is a very easy to spot mechanic, she will place a rather small AOE on the ground on a player of her choice, or NEAR a player. Hands will come out of the ground and pull the player in to the hole stunning them in place. The simple resolve to this mechanic is 'don't stand in it'. \n\n|cffff00Skeletons|r - Another small AOE similar to the one above but this one actually spawns 4x skeleton enemies. These should be killed quickly with AOE damage and the tank should try to grab them and put them with the boss (chains,range taunts, don't run around the room). These if controlled will not cause much of a problem BUT if you run around the room panicking you are going to distract the group from the rest of the mechanics and risk wiping everyone out. Keep co-ordinated and don't panic. If they are on you, just block until the tank can grab them, or kill them fast, whichever works best for your group. They do heavy attack though so look out for those.\n\n|cffff00BLAST|r - This HUGE obvious growing AOE is very simple. Get out of it or die. When you see it spreading, move backwards until you are out of it, and then when it is gone get back in again. A tank can withstand the damage if they are chunky enough but will get knocked back. A dps or healer will die in one shot.\nPay attention and once it is gone, get back into your assigned position. Again running around is going to make things a MESS, so find your spot and only move when you have to, then get back where you were.\n\n"

This boss follows pretty much the same rules as the rest of the in game variants. He has lots of light attacks which really hurt, he has a flame breath and all that good stuff. This is a very simple fight. As the tank, grab it, hold a taunt, turn it away from the group and STAND STILL. Do not run around, do not try dodge rolling with the maelstrom shuffle dance just hold it still and don't let it go.\n\n|cffff00Casters|r - This boss spawns set of ranged adds, be sure to chain these in as the tank and aoe should manage them but interrupts will be required so they don't overwhelm the group with ranged damage. Stack them on the boss asap.\n\n|cffff00Flame Breath|r - Every so often the boss will breath fire in the direction of his choice, usually at the tank. As dps or healers you need to be sure to step out of this asap! As the tank simply block it and you will be fine. This has high damage but also applies a stun so be careful.

Be sure to have a nice tight formation planned for this and be sure that the tank holds her still. No spinning, no running, just hold it still and keep that taunt up!\n\n|cffff00Radiated Beam|r - The boss will rain down a beam onto targets of her choice, a big white flash from above is what you are looking for. This is the reason you do NOT stack. If you do stack and two people get hit one after the other and they have low resists they will die. It has aoe splash damage so be sure to be at least 3-5meters away from each other if you can help it unless you have a nova on the ground to negate some of the damage.\n\n|cffff00Hoavars OP!|r - These tiny little adds spawn near the boss. One blue one and one green one. These represent the bonus they give when they die. The tank can pin these next to the boss (remember not to spin the boss around) they have VERY low damage and health. These should be focused.\n\nOnce they die, get any stamina character to stand in the left over green effect from the green one and get any magicka to stand in the blue effect left by the dead blue one.\nThey give a MASSIVE boost to max resources and recovery so that you can full out NUKE the boss while the buffs are present. It is physically impossible to run out of resources so spam away!\n\n"

She looks a lot scarier than she actually is but this is the first place in which you will see some VERY relevant mechanics as far as the last boss is concerned so you must pay attention. The tank should hold her in the middle of the room and maintain a taunt while holding her still. The group should stand behind the boss at all times with enough room to see what each player is doing.\n\n|cffff00Casters|r - There will be a couple of magblade type casters using ranged effects. These can be interrupted. The adds should be pulled in with the boss and focused only with AOE, they have extremely low health so do not pose much of a threat so long as the tank can manage them.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is extremely simple, look for the heavy attack as the tank and be sure to block it else she will knock you a long way backwards. If the boss is on the dps or healer for any reason, same applies, be sure to block it!\n\n|cffff00Shadows|r - These shadows are the key points of the fight and crucial for the last boss. They will spawn and mind control/fear players at random. You MUST kill these else it is absolute chaos. They don't have a huge amount of health and can be managed with aoe in a high damage group. However if you intend on killing the last boss on hard mode i would familiarize yourself with this mechanic, else your PUGs (pick up groups) will be REALLY tricky. Kill the shadows!\n\n"

In fact no other boss in dungeons has this mechanic so be sure to pay attention. The boss has 3 adds to start with before he spawns. Kill these and he will come through the portal. The tank should hold the boss as still as possible either at the bottom of the stairs or the middle of the room. The dps and healers should stay behind the boss and spread out a little so that they do not stack.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - A simple heavy attack which should be blocked or else you will get knocked down. This is fine for even a dps to block as it does barely any damage.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - As a dps you do not want to be in his face, he can swipe in front of him. It isn't devastating but it applies a tiny stifle/knock back effect.\n\n|cffff00?Double purpose aoe!|r - This is simple at first glance. The boss will place AOEs on the ground, which you MUST stay out of. They do a LOT of damage so you must move out of them fast.\n\nHOWEVER! The boss will go into a phase where the room will change color/tone and the AOEs on the ground will change to WHITE. When this happens you must get INSIDE the aoe to protect yourself. This is the mirror of the usual aoe idea. AOE normally damages you for being inside of them, but this damages you for NOT being inside of them. Once the screen goes back to normal and they are no longer white, get OUT again asap.\n\n"

The boss doesn't need to move at all, as with most of the bosses in this dungeon you can simple hold him still and beat on him. However of course there are mechanics you need to be aware of.\n\n|cffff00Casters|r - There are 4x adds in the room all of which can cast ranged abilities to fear/damage the group. The tank can chain these in onto the boss and stack them up but also their casts can be interrupted so pay close attention to these while killing them with AOE. If any get CC'd at range you may have to focus it down to save it being an annoyance, but generally these die really fast.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - Very simple, regardless of who has agro (although this should always be the tank) if you are targeted by this heavy attack you MUST block it. Don't run, just block.\n\n|cffff00Ground aoe|r - The boss will place ground AOEs on the ground which do nasty poison damage. Simply stay out of these, they are very easy to see and stay out of. No need to run around the room just watch your feet.\n\n"

This is a big target in a small space and yes you CAN fall off the cliff. So watch your feet! The tank needs to grab Bogdan and hold him still at all costs. Do NOT run around the room and focus what you are doing. It helps if you spread out a little as dps and healers and don't stack on each others feet.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is very simple and easy to spot. Bogdan will wind up a huge punch/slap and knock you over. This MUST be blocked. Even if you are a dps and this for some reason hits you, you MUST block.\n\n|cffff00Flames|r - The boss will raise head into the air and launch a fireball which will cover an area of the ground usually aimed at the dps/healers. When this lands, simply stand out of it and carry on doing what you are doing. Don't run around headless, just step aside.\n\n|cffff00Shadows|r - This s the important mechanic mentioned above for the twilight boss. These shadows will spawn around the boss and if you do not kill them they will mind control/fear members of the group and YES they can mind control you OFF the cliff and INTO fire! If you do not kill these fast enough, more will spawn and you will get overwhelmed. Yes this also means more than one person can be controlled/feared at once. These are KEY targets and must be killed at all costs.\n\n|cffff00Healers|r - Another annoying mechanic, just like the shadows, some white versions of them will spawn. However these do NOT fear/mind control you, instead these heal the boss. You have two choices here. You can interrupt them every time they heal and keep focus on the boss OR you can simply kill them. If you do not kill them, you can have more than one in the room and unless you are good at interrupts you will end up in trouble. The boss will heal far too much. My recommendation is interrupt any that you see as soon as you see them, and then focus them down!\n\n|cffff00?JUMP|r - During the fight the room will be somewhat filled with fire, do not panic. The boss will jump into the air. When he does this be sure you are NOT in fire and that you are BLOCKING. A successful block will allow you to live, but at the same time all flames, all shadows and all healers will be removed. The fight is rinse repeat from there.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

As you would expect from the first boss of a dungeon this is not particularly challenging HOWEVER there are still mechanics to follow and this one is MOSTLY all about the tank. Taunt the boss, tun it away from the group, and STAND STILL.\n\n|cffff00Bite|r - Very standard light attack type effect. This does a small amount of damage and the tank CAN block it but it isn't normally necessary. A chunk tank will be able to brush these attacks off, however a dps without a healer taking too many of these bites can cause a problem. This should only ever really be hitting the person with agro anyway (the tank) so the tank should constantly hold a taunt to save any issues.\n\n|cffff00Tail Swipe|r - This mechanic is very simple indeed. The boss will wind up a heavy attack and show a cone AOE visual. This is your time to block! IF you do not block you will be thrown across the room and the boss will then chase and follow up with a bite. Tanks can stand up to this easily but a dps or healer can take some large damage from it if not blocked. The key point to this is to hold the boss still (as the tank) and always block this mechanic. It is very simple of course but if you do NOT do this, the boss will run a bit wild, leave the floor dps abilities and people have to mess about scrambling to re-apply damage at a different location. Also the dps do NOT need to run around the room OR be in the bosses face. stay behind the boss and stand still, dancing doesn't impress him!\n\n"

You need to watch your feet as a group, co-ordinate and don't run around the room like a headless chicken, it will NOT help. He can be taunted to apply the debuff BUT he will hit whoever he likes with his mechanics. Stand in a formation where you all have your own space close to the boss and keep those heals coming!\n\n|cffff00Mist|r - Garron will occasionally channel energy and release a mist cloud in the room. This will chase one player and if caught will do a decent amount of damage over time. Simply move in a small circle around it to avoid it until it has gone. DO NOT run to Grathwood! (yes that was sarcasm) A small circle is all you need.\n\n|cffff00Restless Souls|r - Every so often the boss will teleport across the room, usually just before he does you will hear him chant. When this happens he will spawn ghosts around the room. The tank should chain/pull these on top of the boss so that they can be damage down in AOE with the boss. HOWEVER keep in mind that these ghosts can hit quite hard. They channel an ability which CAN be interrupted (all players pay attention to these). If you fail to interrupt them, a nasty spinning ice effect will be thrown at the agroed player doing high damage and immobilizing them on the spot. You can walk out of its range but if caught it can cause problems.\n\n|cffff00Orb/shot|r - Occasionally Garron will channel a casting ability and fire a single target direct damage magic orb at his chosen target. THIS is why you stand away from each other in your own spaces. IF he aims at you, you have two choices, block or dodge roll...Either is fine but failure to do either will knock you back a LONG way and do high damage. Some dps and/healers wont survive this so be on your toes!\n\n"

He has some very simple mechanics and most of which can actually be avoided/controlled BUT if you don't pay attention things can get messy fast.\n\n|cffff00Skeever swarm|r - When he shouts 'come to me my minions' he will summon a large group of skeevers. These have low health and don't individually hit too hard but if not controlled quickly by the tank and killed in aoe fast by the dps these can stack up and become a problem. Do not panic. If they are on you, worst case scenario BLOCK until the tank has control but do NOT run around the room, running will kill you in the back of the head and make it really tough for the tank to regain control chasing after the things that are chasing you. stand still!\n\n|cffff00Magic bomb|r - When he raises his staff he will summon a large magic orb which will land on whoever has agro (should be the tank) which explodes when it hits the ground. It does a small amount of tick damage over time but doesn't hit the tank too hard, dps and healers should step out of this. However his ability can be interrupted meaning it can be controlled and if paying enough attention, you never have to see it happen.\n\n|cffff00Slam|r - This ability is also channeled and can ALSO be interrupted. He will cast swirling ice at the target (tank or whoever has agro) this can hurt quite a bit if it hits a dps so be careful, and the target affected will be immobilized. Interrupt this and the mechanic will never happen.\n\n"

Simple mechanics that go wrong very fast. Firstly there is a room full of enemies that should be carefully dispatched in the middle of the room. THEN the boss should be pulled down the stairs. Be careful however, frantic running around the room will pull him early and you will have to deal with him and the adds at the same time.\n\n|cffff00Fear|r - This does exactly what it says on the tin. He will channel for 1 second and then shout causing ALL group members to be feared in a random direction. You MUST maintain your stamina for this fight for THIS mechanic. As soon as he fears you all you MUST break free and get back into position. Position is key, keep the fight as central as possible or else this will get messy FAST.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Not always at the same time, sometimes this is random, BUT usually while being feared (if you don't break fast enough) whoever has agro (hopefully the tank) he will chase down and wind up a very large heavy attack. If blocked by the tank or a dps/healer you will survive and be absolutely fine taking barely any damage. However if you do NOT block it...you are dead. BLOCK, do NOT run!\n\n|cffff00Whirlwind|r - Occasionally between the above mechanics he will spin his weapon around his head causing a small physical damage over time AOE. This is extremely simple, step out of it...do NOT run away.\n\n"

The tank should hold this boss in the center at all times to prevent him running in and out of damage but it is a little tricky due to the randomness of his mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - Like any heavy attack, this must be blocked. Not blocking will result in a knockdown and lots of damage taken. So pay attention. The tank should be the only one getting heavy attacked but if things go wrong and you are a dps being hit, just block. do NOT run.\n\n|cffff00Burst|r - Occasionally the boss will cast a fast growing AOE on the ground. If you step out of this, you will be fine. if not then you will take a LOT of damage and be knocked down and stunned. You will have to break free after the stun if you actually managed to survive it. A tank can take it but everyone else must get out of it. Also it has a bit of a delay on it meaning it will hit you before it has fully spread, so get out FAST.\n\n|cffff00Strike|r - Occasionally the boss 'randomly' jump, spin and cast a very large thin cone shaped shock wave type physical attack. This can be avoided with a dodge roll, stepping out of it OR a block BUT you must be very very fast to react. It will randomly hit whoever it feels like and knocks back /down whoever it hits.\nThe damage isn't high but it IS annoying and as a tank if you miss the block, the boss will move to your knocked down location taking him OUT of the group's ground based aoe..hold him still, think fast and block or move.\n\n"

If your tank cannot pay attention to heavy attacks, you are all going to die. If the group doesn't co-ordinate and pay attention, you will all die. IF people run around the room, you will all die. She is simple but one tough cookie. As you would expect from a nightblade, she can one shot anyone in the room if not paying attention.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is simple heavy attack with a kick. IF you are dps and you block this, chances are even though you blocked (unless you are magicka with a shield while blocking) you will either die or be close to death (her follow up attack WILL kill you). If you are the tank she SHOULD only be doing this to YOU...block it. if you do NOT block, you are dead in one shot no matter how chunky you are!\n\n|cffff00Spin|r - After her heavy attack she will do a very fast steel tornado type spin. Whether you are dps, healer or tank you MUST block this. It does a huge amount of damage and any close by members of the group will take an aoe hit form it. If you do not have max health this will most likely kill you. Two choices, block it, or don't stand so close to the boss (always stand behind not in front also).\n\n|cffff00Ambush|r - As you would expect from a nightblade, she can teleport strike you in the back. This is random, can hit anyone and the victim must be fast and BLOCK! then be careful, after this attack she will go to the agroed target(usually the tank) and sometimes followup with another spin attack. If you personally were ambushed and didn't block, then get hit with the spin after, you are dead. Again, do NOT run around...BLOCK.\n\n|cffff00Bats|r - Throughout the fight she will disappear and spawn 4/5 vampire bats. Kill these with AOE damage and control them with the tank, do NOT run away it messes everything up. As soon as they are dead she will re-spawn aiming at the tank (or whoever has agro) and instantly hit with a heavy attack.\n\nNOTE: This heavy attack starts winding up while she is invisible so pay attention to the splashing spark type heavy attack visual. OR just hold block once the bats are dead.\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - The final phase under 25% health, after the last bat swarm...she will go into a black form with red glowing eyes and start hitting harder! The mechanics are all exactly the same (minus the bats) as the rest of the fight however occasionally she will stun the group with a soul tether type attack. be sure to break this if you get stunned FAST, she follows up with a spin and/or heavy attack.\n\n"

The most simple yet dangerous mechanic is shown as you enter the room in order to activate the fight. This must be paid attention to. First of all make sure the dps and healers spread out a bit and make the tank hold the boss still on the platform or in the middle of the room. Turn her AWAY from the group at all times.\n\n|cffff00Ground AOE|r - Throughout the fight the boss will place many AOEs on the ground, these are very large and very easy to see, simply keep your feet out of these as much as possible.\n\n|cffff00Lift|r - This mechanic is very simple indeed. The boss will choose a member of the group and lift them off the ground doing damage over time to them the whole time they are in the air. The boss goes into a purple ghost form and cannot be attacked! The ONLY way to release your team mate and continue with the fight is if 2 people from the group activate the shrines on the left and right of the room. Once activated she will release the member of the group and return to normal.\n\nThese two shrines are activated to START the fight, so if you have started...you already know where these are. Assign people to go left and right at the beginning. Two one way , two the other, that way no matter who gets lifted, there will always be one member from each side able to press the buttons.\n\n"

Hold this boss in the center of the room if possible, putting him in a corner can be VERY bad. Do not drop taunt on him as he can one shot an unaware squishy.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - The boss will do the same spinning weapon type cleave as the original version and this can be very easily avoided by simple stepping backwards a couple of feet. It is small and easy to avoid so do NOT stand in it, and do not run away, there is no need\n\n|cffff00Restless Souls|r - During the fight the boss will wind up a really nasty heavy attack. This will always be on whoever has agro (should be the tank) but regardless of who it is in, the receiver MUST block! If you block it will do minimal damage, but if you do not, you are DEAD! Do not run away, just block. Warning however, the heavy attack connects before the animation is over so block early!\n\n|cffff00Fear/Fire|r - The boss will fear the entire group and you will all run to the outsides of the room. You can break free of this but be careful! When you break free, fire will be placed where you stopped, and it will stay on the ground. So each fear phase, 4x flame aoes will be placed. You MUST step out of this as soon as you break free else you will die in less than about 2 seconds as a dps/healer.\n\n"

You have I'm sure seen many Bone Colossus so far in the game, this is just a bigger version. The tank should turn it away from the group and hold it still with a taunt, while blocking heavies, that is pretty much it.\n\n|cffff00Skeletons|r - Periodically the boss will spawn skeletons from his feet, these can be stunned/cc'd by the tank and are very low health. Do not run away from these just keep them still. If you kill them with aoe fast then no problem, if not they will charge up and explode doing close quarter aoe damage. It isn't high damage but dps and healers should avoid it.\n\n|cffff00Cone Attack|r - The boss will heavy attack and slam in cone aoe in front of him. So long as the tank has this turned away from the group this wont be a problem. All you have to do is block.\n\n"

The tank should taunt the boss and turn it away from the group. The group should spread to their own positions ready to avoid the incoming mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Ground AOE|r - There will be lots of fast landing AOES one the ground, do NOT run away like a loon with the maelstrom shuffle, simply step out of them as they land and you will be fine.\n\n|cffff00Lich Crystal/ghosts|r - Periodically the boss will spawn 4x lich crystals. These pop from the ground with high aoe damage and each one will spawn a ghost from it. These MUST be chained in by the tank and/or focused down by the dps. They can be interrupted and if they are not they will throw out huge ice damage across the ground.\nIf you do not kill these fast enough you will get a second wave of them and the room will get out of control with too much incoming damage.\n\n|cffff00Teleport and leech|r - The boss will teleport during the fight to another location and then attach a leeching beam to every member of the group doing MASSIVE damage over time. You must run to where there boss is and continue the fight as normal but your healer must focus heals on this phase else you will wipe. If you have a shield/heal as a dps/tank you will need to make use of these to help the group.\n\n"

It has very similar mechanics to the smaller versions of itself. The tank should grab the boss and center it in the room while trying to stack the adds in the room with it. Focus aoe on the adds and single target on the boss. But the boss must not be facing the group.\n\n|cffff00Fear|r - The boss will lean backwards like it is charging up and then release a version of itself in the direction of it's chosen target. simply step aside when this happens and let it run it's path. If it touches you it will do MASSIVE damage and fear you. DPS or Healers generally cannot stand up to this so keep your eyes open. The tank can pretty much block it if they really have to but a simple step to one side will be more than safe enough as it will hit NO one.\n\n"

So long as the tank has a taunt on BOTH bosses it wont be a problem. They do not hit very hard and don't have many mechanics to focus on. It is more about stacking them. The trick to this is to make sure that the tank stands ON the archer and the melee will stack with it. Remember ranged targets always work towards their range, so if you move to THEM, you can control them, if not they wont come to you unless you are out of their range. So, grab the melee, and stack it ON the archer boss's feet. This way the group can push as much aoe as possible while focusing the appropriate boss as and when required.\n\nHard mode is achieved by killing 15 zombies. As shown in the video they come from 2 different places. Key point: DO NOT! pull any zombies until the boss is agressed or it will not count. Once the fight starts, pull them all in and drop ultimates to dispatch them fast.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The melee boss will fire off a nasty heavy attack which needs to be blocked. This is a low damage heavy attack and has a knock back. Even a dps or healer can block this with no issue, but this SHOULD be on the tank so long as the tank is maintaining a taunt.\n\n|cffff00Cone|r - The Melee boss will occasionally fire off a long thin cone aoe, this has high damage and knockdown. As the tank, simply block it, but dps/healers should step to one side to avoid it.\n\n|cffff00Circle Aoe|r - The melee boss will occasionally have a negative aoe surrounding him. The tank will be fine standing in this but dps and healers should be careful as this does do damage over time for those caught inside of it\n\n|cffff00Bats|r - Throughout the fight the bosses will disappear and spawn 4/5 vampire bats. Kill these with AOE damage and control them with the tank, do NOT run away it messes everything up. These don't hit very hard and once they are killed the bosses will reappear.\n\n|cffff00Shields|r - One of the bosses randomly will get a damage shield for 20seconds. While this is active, keep the AOE damage up and focus the OTHER boss until the shield is gone.\n\nGood Luck\n\n"

The mechanics are extremely simple if you understand 'don't stand in stupid' BUT all too often players are constantly frustrated with the lack of attention payed by people thinking they can just yolo. SO the biggest tip for this is, WATCH YOUR FEET!\n\n|cffff00Lamias|r - This room is FULL of Lamia type enemies and while the tank needs to keep the attention of the boss he/she ALSO needs to position all of the adds together as soon as possible so that they can be dispatched with as much aoe damage as possible. They do not have a huge amount of health but there are a lot of them. They fire off heavy attacks and abilities/screams that can be interrupted, so everyone should be on their toes. NOTE: do NOT stack the adds on the boss... pull them to one side in case the boss coils.\n\n|cffff00Whip|r - This is very large frontal aoe attack where the boss will tail whip in the direction of whoever has  the agro (Should be the tank) If you are inside of this you should either block it, or dodge roll out of it. The simplest way is for the tank to position the boss facing away from the group while the group stay behind to avoid it. If not blocked you WILL be knocked backwards. Before and after this sometimes comes a nasty heavy attack so be careful.\n\n|cffff00Poison Coil|r - WATCH YOUR FEET! This mechanic is crucial and requires people to pay attention. The boss will coil up in a ball and a LARGE poison aoe will be placed. I shouldn't need to tell you to stay out of it since it is clearly going to hurt, however it has a major additional problem... IF you stand inside of it, every tick of poison will HEAL the boss at about 5% per second, which can be a nightmare, stay OUT of the poison. just step back a bit and wait while damaging from range.\n\n"

So attention must be paid to position. The tank should hold the boss in one position, do not run around in circles just stand still. Each member of the group should also find their own position in a clean formation so when the boss randomly turns it is VERY easy for people to see WHO is targeted. Running around or stacking up will NOT help!\n\n|cffff00Lightning Breath|r - This attack will be aimed at whoever has the agro so be sure the tank is taunting, failing that if it aims at a dps of healer you can get OUT of it by moving to one side, he doesn't move or spin while this is channeling. This is a lightning breath attack which can devastate a squishy so BE careful. The tank should block or simple move a bit and then get back into position when it is gone. It lasts about 4 seconds and ticks each second with damage.\n\n|cffff00Lightning wave|r - Position is KEY. Everyone should have their own space for this mechanic specifically. He will aim randomly at a member of the group and fire a ground aoe in a straight light at them, this does lightning damage and straight after it connects he will hit with a direct damage lightning attack which can  stun the same target (don't stack), if you are quick you can move out of the wave, but if not then shields/blocking can prevent a large amount of the damage. Note this is a FAST attack. But if he looks at YOU, you know it's your turn to avoid it (hence staying in your own positions, stacking makes it impossible to tell who is the target and more than one person will get hit).\n\n|cffff00Shock Pulse|r - Every so often he will emit a large PULSE ability which does a small amount of lightning damage and will briefly stun ALL of group members, this is unavoidable but of course can be somewhat mitigated with resists, If your healer is on point or you have shields this wont cause much of a problem but be sure not to dip too low health wise because mixed with the other mechanics it can be an issue.\n\n"

Well not in this case. She has a pet snake, tip: DON'T kill it. The tank should taunt the boss and leave the snake alone.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is where your tank should be blocking (or whoever has agro at the time) if you miss the block she WILL knock you down and it can be a pain as she follows up with some light attacks afterwards. A tank will be less easy to kill but a dps or a healer will probably die. make sure you are blocking this if it is on you. The tank should be turning the boss AWAY from the group to make sure they are not facing her damage anyway.\n\n|cffff00SCREAM!|r - A very fun mechanic but above all the reason why you should NOT kill the little snake pet.\nDuring the fight Sliklenia will run to a location and scream constantly doing damage to all players no matter where you are in the room. Do NOT run around like a headless chicken, you will just look stupid and die. What you need to do is follow the mechanic. When She ran to her location, the SNAKE also ran to another location..find the snake, you will see that it is coiled up and created a shield over itself. Get inside the shield and you will take ZERO damage from the scream. You can damage her from inside the shield. Once the screaming is over, get back into position and rinse repeat.\n\nNOTE: after she is dead don't forget to press the button in the room to lower the drawbridge to the next fight.\n\n"

She has many additional Lamias along side her and these should all be positioned around/on the boss so they can die to aoe damage. The dpos and healer should spread out for the upcoming mechanics and of course be aware of interrupts. Running around the room will do nothing but kill people, so RELAX!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Simple yet effective, you've seen them before! Make sure the tank has agro on the boss and this heavy attack coming in should simply be BLOCKED. If you are a dps or a healer and this is on you, same applies, block it. If you don't it will knock you down and hurt like hell. IF she is on the wrong person do NOT run around the room, she will just kill you in the back of the head. Relax, block and recover.\n\n|cffff00Double Lightning Splash|r - Every 10 seconds she will call down a large blast of lightning on a random member of the group. This has 2x aoe circles, one in the middle and a larger one overall, basically one on top of the other. DO NOT stack up. find your own space. If you are hit by the outer aoe you will survive but it WILL hurt. So try to dodge roll or move out of it and then get straight back in again and continue fighting. IF however you are anything BUT the tank and you are caught in the MIDDLE aoe, you have a very high chance to get one shot and die! Do NOT get hit by the middle circle.\n\n "

He has some heavy attacks and basic mechanics that the others have with a couple of alterations. The tank should hold this boss very still and face him AWAY from the group, while pulling in any additional enemies so they can be killed with aoe damage. The group should position themselves in their own space behind/beside the boss to avoid stacking. Pay attention to interrupts and frontal aoe from the adds.\n\n|cffff00Slam|r - Basic heavy attack with knockback attached to it. Be sure you BLOCK this if it is on you as it can do quite a lot of damage.\n\n|cffff00Shake!|r - Throughout the fight you will notice the boss shaking and throwing ground aoe's all over, this can be interrupted, so watch your feet if the damage hits the ground and interrupt when you see it.\n\n|cffff00Beam|r - Occasionally the boss will put a green beam on a random player draining their life, you must shield/bloc/heal through this as it hurts a LOT!\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - Under 50% health the boss will enrage with a lightning charge. When this happens his ground aoe gets MUCH stronger, so be weary and don't stand in his face too long. If your healer is on point this shouldn't be much of a problem but pay attention none the less.\n\n"

The tank should keep agro at all times but the group should be in a formation that allows them to all have their own space CLOSE to the boss. She will do random attacks and you NEED to see who is being hit.\n\n|cffff00Channeled Strikes|r - This is her main attack, she will raise her hands and call down several AOE blasts which do damage over time to certain islands in the area. This is VERY simple if controlled.The tank should hold her ON (yes on not near) one of the islands. When she fires off this ability, everybody get in the water. When it finishes, everyone get back into the fight. KEEP her on the island at ALL times if you want this to be a smooth run.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - Basic heavy attack which can knock down, this MUST be blocked, don't run around the room, not only will she kill you in the back of the head, WORSE things happen.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - Very often she will attack a random player, so be careful of this, however if you are TOO far away she will charge the player trying to escape. DO NOT run around the room, stay close.\n\n|cffff00Scream|r - Sellistrix will scream usually in the direction of the tank BUT pay attention. IF the taunt is dropped and she spins onto one of the group members, she is ALREADY on motion and will scream in the direction she was last standing in when the taunt dropped. This means that she will scream AT a dps and/or healer! This is a devastating attack that most cannot stand up to. Your tank needs to STAY on that taunt, and if this does face you either block and shield while the healer works hard OR try to get out of it by moving/dodge rolling. This does a knock back and will put you off balance so this is VERY dangerous.\nNOTE: moving away does NOT mean run around the room, you will kill everyone if she goes rogue.\n\n|cffff00Damage shield|r - Sellistrix has a damage shield on her for the majority of the fight which she consistently reapplies. This means direct damage will not critical strike while she has the shield. This makes the fight a bit longer but that is the SAFE way to do it.\n\n|cffff00Charged water|r - This is Crucial. IF she touches the water, she will constantly electrecute it. Meaning ANYONE standing in water will take MASSIVE damage every tick and most likely will NOT survive. SO keeping her on the island at all times allows you to never have this mechanic happen and of course mean that you can utilize the water area when the aoes land from Channeled strikes. Hold her STILL!\n\n|cffff00EXPERIENCED METHOD (note: High risk)|r - ONLY do this if you are VERY experienced...\nRather than keeping her on the island and moving in and out with the aoe's to keep it clean(but she has a damage shield) there is a more difficult tactic that can be applied.\n'IF' your tank can position the boss so that SHE is in the water, but YOU are all on the island. She will zap the water (meaning you must NOT touch it ever) and remove her own damage shield. This means 'crits are IN!'. It is a faster way to kill ger but requires HIGH co-ordination. I would NOT recommend this for new groups but if you can nail it, it is fun and fast.\n\n"

He can however still hurt the group with various affects which if not paid attention to can one shot a squishy and/or wipe a group. so watch your feet!\n\n|cffff00Double Slam|r - This is a pretty simple melee attack that should only hit the person with agro (ie the tank hopefully) and can be blocked, it shouldn't cause much of a problem\n\n|cffff00Thorny Backhand|r - This is a backhand animation and adds a bleed to the target so this should hopefully ONLY be hitting the tank meaning others don't receive this damage\n\n|cffff00Fiery Explosion|r - The boss will shake violently throwing fireballs all around landing on the ground making aoe splash effects, you need to avoid these as dps/healer as much as possible. one or two hits can kill anything that is not a tank so watch your feet. Do not sprint around the room like a loon, just watch where you stand and move a little bit as and when you need too. Also during this phase he does close aoe fire damage from his location so stand back a bit.\n\n|cffff00Tunneling Roots|r - When he stomps the ground he will make roots stream across the floor and whoever is caught in this will be immobilized on the spot (rooted) simple avoid this by moving left or right when you see it coming, OR dodge roll out of it if you get caught. it does a decent amount of physical damage so be careful not to get caught out if you are not the tank.\n\n"

A tank can stand up to it if something goes wrong but a dps or healer (if agro is on them) MUST block of they will most likely die.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - he will spin her sword around her head, anyone caught in it will take physical damage over time. This is very obvious and easy to see, simply stay out of it and you will be fine.\n\n|cffff00Summon Banekin/daedra|r - Throughout the fight He will summon 3 banekins (he starts with 3 also when you initiate the fight).\nThese banekin do the same as all other banekins, they have lightning damage and can explode so you must get rid of them quick of the combined damage can be a problem. If you have high damage in your group then just basic aoe damage will kill them in no time at all, however if not...then you are going to have to follow mechanics more. Get your tank to pull them together and hold them in place while the dps do aoe damage to gradually kill them. Most case you don't need to taunt them because they die fast but in this sort of scenario, your tank should be on point and grab them fast! Do NOT run around the room panicking because minions have spawned, relax, control and kill.\n\n"

Your tank should try to keep him on his starting platform as much as possible and turn him AWAY from the group. Do not run around the place you do not have room, simply watch your feet!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The boss occasionally will fire off a nasty dual wield heavy attack with a MASSIVE knock back. You as the tank MUST block this or the fight is going to get messy fast! If a dps or healer has it they MUST also block it or they will most likely die, but above all your tank needs to be sure that this attack is ON the tank and not the squishies. Hold him still, block the heavy, don't panic.\n\n|cffff00Blazing Fire|r - The boss (usually after the heavy attack) will spin (same visual as steel tornado) and put a ring of small fire aoes around him on the ground. Sometimes it will be clustered up, in which case stay away from it. Other times it can have a gap in the middle which you can stand in and take no damage. Keep an eye on which one it is and position yourself accordingly. do NOT stand in the fire, it does damage over time and it REALLY hurts. You especially don't want this on your head after failing a heavy attack block.\n\n|cffff00Teleport strike|r - IF someone decides to run away from the boss, he WILL punish you. Stay close don't panic and pay attention to his mechanics. IF you are the furthest away, he will teleport strike you in the back (just like the nightblade skill). If you see this coming, you must block. And also realize that YOU are the furthest away. Reposition yourself and stop running away.\n\n"

She has all the same base effects as the enemies throughout the dungeon but she is a LOT stronger. She spawns with a few adds once the gate is clear and the tank should grab these right away, stack them on top of her and turn her away from the group.\nHer basic fireball attacks can be blocked and should only hit whoever has agro (hopefully the tank) and are easy to manage.\n\n|cffff00Lava Geyser|r - This is an extremely easy to spot mechanic. Small spreading aoes on the ground which erupt like a geyser of lava! The tank can with stand this if blocking but this is primarily cast on people that do NOT have agro. This is a very simple mechanic to avoid and all you need to do is simply, step out of it, wait for it to blow up, and then get back in position again. Do NOT run around the room and do not stay inside of it, this can one shot a dps or healer if you are of lower cps/resists.\n\n|cffff00Combustion|r - Don't celebrate just yet! As soon as she is dead people have a habit (myself included) of running to that boss and grabbing that shiny loot! Hang fire! Wait for her to hit the ground and stand back a few seconds. When she dies she emits a Small aoe around her body and then it will explode. This will one shot a dps or healer with NO problem at all. This can also give a tank a run for it's money.\n\n "

The area you fight in is small and if you run down the stairs she will reset...so don't do it.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - She has a nasty heavy attack that will knock you flying and do a nasty amount of damage especially if she follows up with a light attack afterwards. This will ONLY hit the person who has agro. so if taunted, this will be on the tank.\n\n|cffff00Berserker Frenzy|r - She will spin her sword around her head, anyone caught in it will take physical damage over time. This is very obvious and easy to see, simply stay out of it and you will be fine.\n\n|cffff00Burning Field|r - She will summon pools of fire on the ground which you must stay out of, these are VERY easy to see as they are big burst of fire on the ground. The damage isn't too high but you don't want to be in there for long.\n\n|cffff00Summon Clones|r - Straight after the above mechanic she will spawn 3 clones of her self. These are very similar to the reflections in Helra citadel in that they take MASSIVE damage in comparison to her. This is how your spot which one is which. They deal the same damage as her so should be killed fast. They do not take long to kill BUT if you have any weapons that deal splash damage (lightning staff, 2hander lights and heavies) and you hit a clone, the splash damage will scale off the of the HUGE damage you did to the clone and hit her for a HIGH amount. So tactical play here...Splash damage the clones to hit her harder! The tank at this point should grab all of them and hold them together. It is rare that this gets out of hand but it CAN do so be careful and do not run around the room.\n\n"

This boss is a ranged attacker but there is Lots of fire and there are LOTS of additional minions coming to play, so your tank will need a close ranged and long ranged taunt for this. Hold the boss as still as possible, he moves enough without making things even more difficult.\n\n|cffff00Fire burst|r - Occasionally the boss will fire a projectile in the air and when it lands it will burst causing a 4 way cross affect of fire trailing along the floor (4 different directions from the center). This won't one shot you but this will do a LOT of damage so avoid it as much as possible.\n\n|cffff00Minions|r - Whenever he says 'rise minion' he will summon a flame atronach. These are identical to what you have already encountered in the dungeon, deal nasty flame attacks from range and explode when they die. Your tank should range taunt these to keep the damage off the group while the dps try to dispatch them quickly. Not killing them will result in having way too many of them towards the end of the fight.\n\n|cffff00Teleport|r - Throughout the fight Razor will teleport to a random location. You can simply run to where he is and continue as your were while he repeats his rotation. THIS is your opportunity to throw down ultimates. save ultimates until he moves and drop them on him when he gets there (apart from the start of the fight you can use them, there too of course. The reason for this is if you throw them down mid rotation he COULD teleport out of it and you loose overall dps.\n\n|cffff00Flame Shot|r - Your group should be standing in somewhat of a formation. You all need your own space. This is because periodically he will aim at a chosen member of the group and fire a heavy attack type shot at them. The ability can be blocked and/or dodged BUT if it physically hits you the dot will still stay with you. The fire dot is of a LONG duration, is flame damage and hurts like HELL. HOWEVER there is a clever mechanic to this. If you know for sure it is YOU that was shot. Jump in the water...You will hear a fizz sound like someone threw water on a fire, and it will extinguish the dot.\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - The final phase under 25% he instead of spawning 1 atronach, will in fact spawn 3! This is go time! Get your tank on point with the taunts and either kill all of the atronachs before focusing the boss, or go for the burn and pray. Your call, depends on your group. Good luck!\n\n"

There are actually 3 bosses and no right or wrong order to complete this but i generally kill the melee first because he seems to hit the hardest AND has adds. So. The tank should run straight to the Melee and plant his feet. Turn the boss away from the group and let the group stand behind the boss, spread out.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is a pretty simple melee attack that should only hit the person with agro (ie the tank hopefully) and can be blocked. If you are a dps/healer and this is on your for some reason, same applies. BLOCK. If you do not block you will get plenty of air and probably die. It hits VERY hard and has a massive knock back.\n\n|cffff00Flame Atronachs|r - The boss will spawn Atronachs during the fight, these can be killed quite fast as they have low health. You can either burn the boss and kill them afterwards OR focus these as they come in. This depends on how much damage you have in your group. If you have low damage, be sure to kill the Atronachs asap else you will get too many and it will get difficult.\n\n|cffff00Burst|r - The boss will occasionally channel a huge spreading aoe, all dps and healers should avoid this at all costs. It has a huge knock back and massive damage. The tank can take the damage but will get knocked down so makes sense to dodge roll out of it and then just position back at the bosses feet after it has gone.\n\n|cffff00Healer|r - This boss heals and teleports from time to time. His abilities can be interrupted and he is pretty much stack and burn. Kill him on the spot and only move when he moves.\n\n|cffff00Archer|r - This one fires some nasty aoe flames on the ground, be sure to stay in the gaps when this happens. He can teleport like the healer so follow him when he does. His ability can also be interrupted to prevent damage.be careful not to get caught out if you are not the tank.\n\n"

So pay attention. The tank should of course taunt the boss and hold her still, this is a very static fight so long as people don't run around like crazy.\n\n|cffff00Fire AOE|r - The boss will cast nasty flame circles on the ground which burn on the spot for a few seconds each, sometimes 2-3 at a time. These are very obvious to see and easy to avoid. Do NOT run around the room, just move a couple of feet to step out of them.\n\n|cffff00Summon Adds|r - The boss will periodically summon 2 adds from the center of the fight. These will chase the dps/healers etc to try to kill them but the tank can of course and SHOULD control them and keep them agroed. The adds MUST die! If you do not kill the adds within around 20seconds she will summon them back and the amount of health they have will depend on how much she gets back!\n\nIf the adds don't die she will heal so much the fight will go on forever.

This boss has very low health considering his size but if not controlled can wipe groups out so you must pay attention. The tank should grab the boss and hold him still while always facing him away from the group. The group should spread out close to the back of the boss. Stacking will be dangerous because of stacking aoes.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - The boss occasionally will stomp the ground and the ground will shake in front of him. Anyone caught in the effects will knock them back and do high damage, so dps should NOT stand in front of the boss.\n\n|cffff00Breath|r - This is very typical of a Deadroth, occasionally he will breath fire with a massive cone affect causing HUGE fire damage. The tank can block this but dps/healers have NO business standing in this, stay away from it.\n\n|cffff00Ground pound|r - During the fight the boss will punch the ground, aoes will pop up from the ground under players feet. To avoid this simply move left and right a little to get out of them and you will be fine, do NOT sprint around the room. Simply watch your feet.\n\n|cffff00Dremora Adds|r - At 75% 50% and 25% health the boss will fill the room with a wave of Dremora, you should FOCUS these down as fast as possible, bring them in close and kill them all. THEN after they are dead you can go back to the boss. There are 3 phases of these and if you push the boss from one phase to the next before they are all dead, you WILL get overwhelmed with multiple spawns.\n\n"

Get the tank to grab the boss and turn it AWAY from the group, facing the back of the room or the lava if possible. Note: even when doing 'other stuff' in this fight, the tank MUST maintain a taunt on the titan.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is an extremely easy to spot mechanic. A high damage heavy attack with a cone aoe telegraph. The tank should block this and NEVER spin it on the group. If you are a dps or healer, you can dodge roll backwards or block it depending on if you can time it or not but do not go side to side, it is locked on!\n\n|cffff00Fire splashes|r - During the fight fire splashes/meteor type effects will fire at the group. This is less painful than it looks, simply move your feet and be careful without running away per say.\n\n|cffff00Lock on Fire shot|r - During the fight everyone will get their own locked on aoe effect in the form of a fireball. Black this, don't try to run, you cannot run away from it.\n\n|cffff00Slam and flame wall|r - In the first stages of the fight the boss will slam the ground and knock everyone back. Once this is over he will emit huge waves of flame across the room. Get some distance and move side to side to avoid these. If you do not, they will hit you for fire damage and stun you.\n\n|cffff00Air Atronachs|r - At 65% the boss will move to one platform to summon an Air Atronach. While summoning the Atronach the boss will only take 10% damage so use this 5second period to build up resources with heavy attacks.\n Once the add is fully spawned/summoned it will spin violently at the group and the boss is attack-able again.\nThis is where the tank has to work like hell. The tank needs to hold a taunt on the boss (at range if must) while kiting (keeping at bay) the add (also must be taunted and has a massive damage shield so not worth trying to kill it).\nDuring this phase you can fight the boss as normal and when he hits 35% he will repeat his 65% phase on the right side and wake up ANOTHER Atronach. The tank needs to grab this Atronach too!\n\nSo now the tank has 2 adds, AND the boss. So long as you hold a taunt on all 3 you are free to move around at the back of the room AWAY from the group to keep the adds off them and hold the agro. If you sit and hold block you will most likely die, so keep them on you but don't let them kill you and don't drop the taunts. This is where the rest of the group will be finishing off the boss while you as the tank are distracting the boss and the adds\n\n"

This boss although reduced in difficulty is still to date considered one of the hardest base game bosses for dungeons. There are 5 platforms on the floor, during the fight these platforms are where you will fight the boss and when each one is destroyed you should move to the next (before it explodes). If you run out of platforms, our prayers are with you!\nHard mode removes 2 platforms so you have to kill him in 3 instead of 5. Hard mode can be done with low dps groups but this will require you to focus and have MINIMAL mistakes to pull it off. Watch your feet, be careful and focus! The tank should taunt the boss and try to hold him in the middle of whatever platform he is on at ALL times! The group should be in a semi circle behind the boss with a clear area of space each so that you can all see as and when he turns on EACH member of the group (yes he will do this). If you are stacked and he turns and you are all bunched up, no one knows who the target is. Get in formation and relax...\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is a HUGE hit and will cause a massive knock down(usually into lava) you MUST block this. This should only be on the tank since the tank should be taunting but if you are a dps or healer and you know he is on you, block it!\n\n|cffff00Fireball|r - During the fight (this is why you have your own space) the boss will aim at one random member of the group and charge up a fireball. If you are the one he is aiming at be sure to dodge roll the fireball or you will be knocked backwards (usually far enough to land in the lava).\n\n|cffff00Fossilize|r  - The boss will aim at a random member of the group and like the fireball will throw a projectile at the member. If you are FAST this can be dodge rolled, if not he will turn you into stone of which you MUST break free.\n\n|cffff00Flame wheel|r - I have used this description before but basically from an above view this effect looks like a wagon wheel (spokes). The boss will cast flame onto the ground and straight lines of flame will travel outwards from the center over and over until it is gone. DO NOT PANIC! Get a tiny bit of distance, keep your eyes on it and just stand in the gaps when you can. If it hits you for a couple of ticks you are dead but this can be completely avoided.\n\n|cffff00Smash platform|r - Periodically per platform the boss will stab the center of the platform smashing it to bits. Get off FAST! and move to the next platform that he lands on.\n\n|cffff00Atronachs & Damage Shield|r - When the boss jumps to a new platform, he will raise his sword in the air. During this phase a group of flame Atronachs will spawn around him. These can be chained in and killed with aoe. While he is channeling with his sword up he constantly hits the group with fireballs and has a small damage shield. You must get rid of his damage shield in order for him to stop doing this. Then the fight is rinse repeat of all of the above.\n\nThe faster you can kill him the better for hard mode of course but remember to relax, follow the mechanics and don't panic. Clear mechanic following will make this a breeze, mistakes will mess it all up. And to the nay sayers about vampire? all 4 members in the video are stage four vampire. Fire wont nuke you if you can avoid it ;)\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

He has 4 mage type enemies with him which must be controlled by the tank from the very beginning so they don't run around. The dps and healer also need to pay attention to interupts so don't run around the room, relax and stop them from doing anything stupid. The tank should hold everything as still as possible through out the fight and chain in any adds that try to run away.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is a pretty simple melee attack in the form of an uppercut and must be blocked. Any role can block this but it will only hit whoever is agroed (mainly the tank unless the taunt has droped) It does a lot of damage if NOT blocked, but if you do block it, it doesn't hit too hard. Don't miss the block though else you will get knocked over.\n\n|cffff00Elemental Ring|r - This is donut shaped aoe on the floor usually making the tank sit in the middle. Inside of it and outside of it is the safe area but if you tough the edges you will take a fair amount of damage, so avoid standing in this for long periods of time.\n\n|cffff00Negate|r - usually after the previous effect he will drop a negate bubble on top of the same aoe. So this is the trade off point. if you are dps or healer make sure you are out of it, but as the tank, if you tough the edges, you take damage, in the middle is safe but NOW you are in a bubble which means you have two choices...take damage and leave the bubble, OR stay inside, hold a taunt and block and rely on your healer. The reason you will now be relying on your healer is because INSIDE the bubble you CANNOT use any magicka abilities until it has gone. Stamina abilities, heavy attacks and blocks work, but you magic abilities will not. PLay it however you are comfortable.\n\n"

This is a very simple mechanics, it isnt particularly dangerous, just annoying. Break free and get back to where you were.\n\n|cffff00Ground aoe|r - Throughout the fight he will cast a nasty aoe on the ground, stay OUT of this, it has immobilizing effects and does some nasty damage. Low resist players will die to this very fast!\n\n|cffff00Summon Zombies|r - Throughout the fight the boss will spawn many zombies to help him. They are VERY low health and should die to aoe damage however if your group is lacking in that area do NOT panic. Simple keep doing what you are doing, let the tank control them and they will die in no time. Do NOT run around the room, it makes the tanks job very difficult and just moves enemies out of the damage on the floor.\n\n|cffff00Damage shield|r - At low health the boss will put a damage shield on his health bar. You simple have to kill the health of the damage shield before you can continue to hit his health bar. You cannot crit a damage shield so this may take a little time but the mechanics stay the same. Just focus and you will be fine, inevitably he will die.\n\n"

This fight is all about the tank controlling the boss. If the tank looses control of this boss it is all out mayhem and very hard to get damage on the boss let alone survive his enrage mechanics. This can be really simple or really difficult. It's up to you!\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - This is where your tank has to position the boss so that he can stay in the damage and not run around the room. When he charges he will go in a straight line aiming in the direction he is FACING at the time. So get your tank to position their back into a corner so that he runs straight at the wall. Every time he has finished charging move to another corner close by and repeat the process.\n\n|cffff00Burst|r - After the charge ability he will stamp the ground and creat a fast growing large BURTS aoe. This can be blocked or dodge rolled and is very easy to spot. The damage is not so bad at this stage but you need to avoid it none the less. for dps, simply dodge roll out and then get back in when it is gone.\n\n|cffff00Enraged|r - At low health the boss will buff himself with FIRE! His charge ability now emits a massive fire trail wherever he ran from and to, so do NOT stand in this. Also his burst ability now has an added fire damage burst to it. You can still block and dodge the initial damage BUT the second tick of damage will still hit you and you will be knocked over regardless.

Firstly he cannot go off balance so he is immune to that, meaning the fight will last a little bit longer than most and sustain can be an issue for lesser experienced groups BUT if you pace it you will be just fine. The key is the positioning of your group.\n\n|cffff00Ground aoe|r - A small circle on the floor which does damage overtime and a slight snare, simply avoid these, they happen periodically through out the fight.\n\n|cffff00Lich Crystals|r - Every few seconds, the boss will spawn 2 circles of lich crystals. 5 on the outside and 3 in the middle. They grow in aoe and then explode. This is the most dramatic mechanic but the easiest to avoid. As demonstrated in the video, stay close and just stay in the gaps between them. doing this means you will never take any damage from them.

A high dps group will make mince meat of this guy but we are here to learn about mechanics so of course i shall explain what to do.

Keep the boss central so the group can kill everything in aoe as fast as possible while focusing single target stuff on the boss.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - very so often the boss will aim a heavy attack at the tank(or whoever has agro) this has a nasty knock down and a lot of damage so make sure you block it! Also this can sometimes be done from stealth so be sure to keep your eyes open for the heavy attack sparks effect in thin air if he vanishes and block EARLY.\n\n|cffff00Soul Teather|r - Very much like the nightblade ability, the boss will occasionally stun the group and then life steal each member for 4-5 seconds. The stun can be broken free and you can block the initial damage.\n\n"

Killing one will enrage the other so you CAN kill them both together if you have a lot of damage but this is about mechanics so i will explain how i personally would do this as also descripbed and demonstraited in the video. Get the tank to hold The blue boss with the two hander out of the center circle, and keep a ranged taunt on the red mage boss. This way all the damage will go to the tank excluding aoe damage. This will make the fight MUCH cleaner. The dps should focus the mage and then once it is dead , put the blue one in his place and hold him in the middle. The dps and healer will need to move form mechanics in this fight but do NOT sprint around the room!\n\n|cffff00Athor (blue boss)|r\n\n\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The heavy attack is HUGE, does a lot of damage, a massive knock down and is delayed. This MUST be blocked BUT block the second you see it. It will connect with the target before the visual for the swing actually happens so keep your eyes peeled and block as soon as you see this. This should always be on the tank but if something goes wrong the dps can survive it IF they block. If not, they are dead. Also during the fight and between heavy attacks a lightning dot will be cast on the tank. It does barely any damage.\n\n|cffff00Bubbles|r - occasionally during the fight Athor will cast tiny lightning aoes on the ground with a small dome covering them. Do NOT stand in these they hit you with a nasty amount of lightning damage. No need to panic, they dont move. Just stay out of them.\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - Both bosses have enrage mechanics if you kill the opposite brother, but to make things easier on yourself, always kill zaven (red mage) first else the room can get filled with fire and it is hard to manage. When Zaven is dead Athor will enrage. The tank should take the boss to the center when zaven was and your dps and healers should find their own space and just gradually burn him down. The mechanics are the same as before, the tank can stand still and block heavy attacks BUT now occasionally Athor will call down a rain of lightning. DO NOT PANIC! running around the room will make you run into incoming effects, keep doing what you are doing, relax, do your damage and if any land near you, simple move a little bit out of the way of them and you will be fine. Careful foot work, not headless chicken mode!\n\n|cffff00Zaven (red boss)|r\n\n\n\n|cffff00Flame Burst|r - Periodically Zaven wioll cast a MASSIVE aoe in the room, it will spread and explode. If you are in this you will be knocked down even if blocking. You need to get out of this asap and then get back in position once it is gone. As for the tank, stay out side of this, if you are inside of it and you are knocked down, WHILE Athor is winding up a heavy attack and you accidentally get thrown into a lightning bubble too...you are dead.\n\n|cffff00Fire Trail|r - Occasionally Zaven will raise his hand aiming at whoever has agro. This should be the tank but not always. He will cast a striaght line of flames across the ground. So if it is aiming at YOU, simply move to one side and let it pass. If this hits a dps or a healer, it is pretty much a one shot.\n\n|cffff00The wheel|r - There are several versions of this for multiple bosses in the game but i always refer to it as 'the wheel'. If you can imagine from a birds eye view of a wagon wheel...lots of spokes like the sectioning of a circle, that is how i can best describe this effect. Spokes of flame will fire from the bosses feet. These are low damage, avoidable and not too much of a problem. so just keep your eyes peeled and either avoid them of have a heal to hand.\n\n"

The boss spawns adds through out the fight so the tank will need to keep with the boss but of course be able to grab them as and when they enter the fight. They are based on health however so the faster the burn the faster they spawn. So do NOT dance around the room or this will get messy quickly. The tank should try to hold the boss as central as possible to keep control and avoid panicking people when it really hits the fan.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - Throughout the fight adds will spawn and these must be dealt with, the tank should try to taunt/chain as many in as possible while the group try to focus interrupting the boss. If you have high dps you can pretty much kill all of the adds with aoe, but if your group damage is suffering you can FOCUS the healers and then go back to the boss. Be careful at low health of the boss however because a large flesh Atronach will come out of a portal to join the fight and he will need to be focused. His health isn't high but he does have a nasty heavy attack which will need to be blocked if targeted.\n\n|cffff00AOE Circle|r - The boss will randomly choose a target to place a LARGE circular aoe on the floor under them. If this is you simple move out of it. It is extremely easy to see and doesn't move, so don't panic, just move to the side and carry on as you were.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This doesn't get much simpler, the boss will wind up a HUGE heavy attack with a knock back added to it. Whether you are the tank or not, if this aims at YOU, you *must* block it! This will only aim at the person with agro, so if it is aimed at a dps or healer, the tank dropped the ball!\n\n"

Focus and pay attention to the mechanics and you won't have a problem. The tank should hold the boss in the middle of the room and the group should surround her. Do NOT stack on each others feet. Spread out and stand still to start with.\n\n|cffff00Chasing Aoe|r - During the fight the boss will pick a player at random. A massive aoe will start chasing them. The trick to this is kiting. If you are not familiar with this do not worry, basically it means keep moving. So, if YOU are the target, let your group know it is you, step back about to the outer circle of your group and simple run around the room in a large circle to avoid it, and when it has gone come back into your position. So long as you don't run too far away you can still do damage and/or take heals. Just be sure you do not overlap the aoe onto the group. YOU are in control of it, so it if kills your team mates, YOU didn't control it properly. Relax, BIG circle, get back in...easy.\n\n|cffff00?Spiders|r - Throughout the fight swarms of spiders will spawn. This is when panicking does NOT help. Stay in position, let  the spiders come to the middle. The tank can chain them. taunt them and pin them etc but if you start running around the room when you have agro they are incredibly difficult to control. So let the tank do their job, relax, let the spiders come in and get as much aoe damage down as possible. They do not have a lot of health so are not hard to kill, but it can get messy if people start disco dancing. Remember if you have agro on something, it will chase you until you are dead, so stop running away and take it to the tank!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is pretty simple stuff, she occasionally heavy attacks and this needs to be blocked. Even if you are a dps or a healer, if she is on you, be sure to block this, or you will get a nasty knock back and can make the fight a bit messy.\n\n|cffff00Cocoon!|r - During the fight the boss will randomly wrap up a member of the group in a web cocoon! This is crucial as it could be the tank, the healer, OR the dps and even a person who currently has the 'Chasing aoe'...Wrapped up in a web AND a chasing aoe is you dead.\nThis is when your group has to pay full attention. If anyone is in a cocoon this is when your group needs to run over to them and hit the synergy button to release them ASAP! This is a key mechanic above all. If the tank doesn't get freed, the boss taunt will fall off and she will kill everyone, if the healer is cocooned then no one gets heals, you get the idea!\n\n"

The tank should grab the boss and simply hold it in the middle of the room. Try to keep it as still as possible to not remove him from possible dps aoes on the floor.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Pretty simple stuff here, whoever has agro (should be the tank) will occasionally get heavy attacked! As with every other heavy attack in the game, this needs to be BLOCKED!\n\n|cffff00Skeletons|r - Throughout the fight skeletons will spawn, these need to be killed quickly else they can overwhelm you with multiple spawns. They can be controlled by the tank and killed with low to mid aoe damage, BUT if your group is lacking damage overall, focus these down as soon as possible.\n\n|cffff00Fear|r - The boss will invoke a spirit throughout the fight (very often) to fear the group. You must break free as soon as possible. A lot of the time the fear is followed by a heavy attack so if you don't break free fast enough it will hurt. With the boss being melee based he will of course chase people to their feet when they run away, so if you take TOO long to break free, he will travel a long distance and leave your damage aoes. This is negative to the fight because now the dps have to reapply skills and the fight takes longer. Key points basically are, hold him still, and break free fast so you don't run him around the room. He WANTS to run around the room...don't let him!\n\n"

To start with you will be greeted by the Ilambris twins, Killing ONE of them will result in them disappearing and spawning the boss from the pile on the ground. Do NOT panic. Get in a nice circle, make sure the tank has the agro of the boss and holds him STILL on the pile. NEVER move the boss.\n\n|cffff00Skeletons|r - As with most Bone Colossus types the boss will spawn 3 melee skeletons from time to time, these are very low health and aoe will kill them pretty fast, even low damage. But the tank CAN control these with talons/immobilize abilities/status effects and also taunt them. Simply hold them still, no need to run around.\n\n|cffff00Larger skeletons|r - Another spawn of adds will come into the fight occasionally. These have a fair amount more health than the basic skeletons. However, just like the basic ones, these can be taunted and controlled by the tank. Do NOT run around the room else these will kill you. They can die easily to aoe damage and/or ultimates but if you run, it is almost impossible to control. Stay near the boss and keep doing what you are doing.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - The boss will occasionally stomp the ground, when this happens, simply step out of it or block. Blocking will negate a HUGE proportion of the damage so is probably safer.\n\n|cffff00Rain of Fire|r - Low health the boss will enrage and constantly rain fire on the ground around the group. All you need to do here is step to one side before each one lands. Watch your feet and kill the boss. Nova helps a LOT for this by the way if you have this available in your group.\n\n"

So many people quit on this low health stack and burn fest due to them not being able to co-ordinate. And here is how you avoid those situations...learning the mechanics. For this fight, of course the tank needs to be taunting the boss and keep agro at all times but above all, positioning is KEY!\n\nLook at the room as a clock face. You have 4 players. EACH player takes quarter of the clock. So, people stand at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock, 9 o'clock. DO NOT move from these positions. everyone should have their OWN quarter of the clock! failure to do this WILL result in a wipe and/or silly deaths.\n\n|cffff00Ground Fire|r - very so often the boss put her staff in the air channeling an ability, this will place a nasty aoe under the target of her choice and makes positioning difficult, so be sure when you see this to INTERRUPT her either with a bash or a skill that does such. Do not rely on everyone else to do it, EVERY player can interrupt targets (you were taught this at before level 3 in the tutorial).\n\n|cffff00The Wipe|r - This ability does have a name as such but i like to call it 'The Wipe' because that is what usually happens. The boss will do a suck in mechanic and pull everyone to her feet in mid air. A spreading aoe will appear under your feet and attach itself to you. Yes that means it follows YOU. During this phase an aoe will appear loosely behind each player!\nTHIS is why you must be in the quarter clock formation. EACH player should spin their camera, and dodge roll back into THEIR quarter of the clock and AVOID landing in the ground aoe on their side and AVOID all other players. If your body overlaps another aoe, when they explode. You will DIE.\n\nSo to recap...suck in mechanic, spin your camera, look behind you, dodge roll BACK into YOUR quarter and avoid the ground aoe (and other players) and let the explosion happen.\n\nIt is very simple but if one person does it wrong, you are gonna have a really rough time!\n\n"

There are many almost one shot mechanics in here for people with lower cps or for people not paying attention so you must keep your eyes open. The boss although taunted has SOME mechanics which are random. So everyone must be on their toes. The tank needs to keep a taunt on the boss at all times and the group should be in a nice circle around the boss as not to stack, if you stack it becomes a problem because random targeted players cannot tell WHO is the target. So give each other some room (that doesn't mean sprint around the room).\n\n|cffff00Lich Crystals|r - The boss will raise his hand in the air, when he does this he will spawn lich crystals around the room. A chain will come out of the ground and then a big aoe burst will come from them. These are extremely easy to avoid, simply step out of the aoe. There are many of them so it does look scary but just stay out of them and they wont harm you.\n\n|cffff00Flying Skull|r - Occasionally during the fight the boss will target a random player. He will start channeling  for a brief moment and then let rip with a projectile flying skull at the player of his choice. The reason i stated at the beginning that players need to have their own space is for THIS mechanic. If while channeling he is looking at YOU, then YOU are the target and you need to prepare for it. Once it starts flying at you, dodge roll it. Failure to do so will result in MASSIVE damage and a knock down. Low cp players or glass cannons will take a one shot from this and die, so do NOT miss the dodge roll. Spread out so you can see who the target is!\n\n|cffff00Teleport Blast - The boss will teleport from time to time at a random player, when this happens you must get away from him ASAP! Where ever he lands he will cast a massive spreading AOE on the ground from his feet. It is large enough for a single dodge roll to not be enough if you are too slow. If this hits you, unless you are fairly tanky OR the tank (in which case you will get hit and knocked down) you are pretty much dead in one shot. So, if he teleports, GTFO!\n\n|cffff00Ghosts|r - There are 3 'well' type places on the map with a grill over them. When the boss teleports to these he will release two ghosts. Every time regardless of which one he goes to will be two more. IF you are just going for a completion, kill these fast as you will get overwhelmed. If you are going for hardmode (vet only) you MUST keep these alive. The tank should take the ghosts away and people should NOT be damaging them. In order to complete hard mode you MUST have 4 ghosts alive when the boss reaches for the sword! (35% health).\nHold back on the damage until 4 ghosts are present if your group has a lot of high damage. Be careful not to kill them too early.\n\n|cffff00Taking The sword!|r - At 35% health the boss will reach for the sword in the center of the room. This is 'go time!'. This is when you can kill the ghosts (if going for hard mode) and also when the group needs to focus and staying close to the boss. The tank should hold the taunt and the group should have a tight circle close to the boss. Do NOT run around the room.\n\nWhen the boss grabs the sword the group will be stunned. The boss will then choose a random player in the group and hold him/her in mid air and try to drain them. The player in question must synergies to resist the drain and at the same time the group must do as much damage as possible to remove the new damage shield from the boss and drop the player to safety.\n\nOnce the player has been released, the boss can be controlled with a taunt but he will now fight with the sword doing HIGH melee damage and randomly attack players with a charge attack. So, stay in a circle, and if he aims at YOU, be sure to block.\n\nIf he is still alive for a while he will recycle the drain phase with a damage shield. At this stage, it is rinse repeat. Do not panic and good luck!!\n\n"

Of course most of the time the first one is the easiest to get you into the swing of things but the main thing to remember with this boss especially as the tank is to keep him STILL. There is no need to run at all.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - The boss with hit with a charge attack in the direction of the tank or whoever has agro at the time. This does NOT do a lot of damage and a simple block will be enough, do not run around the room, just be sure to block it and you will be fine. Also he has a lot of light attacks which most tanks should be able to stand up to but if a dps/healer is attacked you should BLOCK not run around the room.\n\n|cffff00Ice wind|r - This mechanic is ongoing and is very simple however with players of lower champion points (lower resist bonuses) you may want to avoid it from time to time.\nBasically the boss has a constant wind aoe surrounding it which ticks with ice damage every second. This also applies a snare affect. Since you should keep this boss very still and just kill him over time the snare is ineffective really, there is NO need to run around the room. However the damage if you do not have a healer will mount up so you have two options. Stand in it and do your damage as a dps while the healer stays out of it and helps you all survive. OR simple do your damage, step out of it and recover and then go back in again. Either method works fine, the damage is really not so bad and if you do dip in health there is plenty of time to get out of the aoe and heal up so long as the tank holds it still!\n\n"

The more you run the more difficult the fight gets. So find your positions and stay there unless the mechanics require you to move. If you have to move, get back into position ASAP!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - his is as simple as it gets, a long swing into a heavy attack which MUST be blocked else you will be knocked down and across the floor. The tank should look out for this and always block it. If the boss is on a dps/healer, same rule applies, block it.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - Position is KEY! Do NOT run around the room, because if you do the target furthest will be charged by the boss and then hit with a nasty frontal aoe effect. He will randomly do this sometimes throughout the fight but generally it is due to people being too far away. If this is happening, reevaluate your groups position and stop running away! If you are being charged you CAN block it, so in the event of this happening, do so. Running around will just get you killed.\n\n|cffff00Breath|r - Every so often he cast a breath attack on the person who has agro (should be the tank). This is a cone shaped affect and should be blocked if possible. The tank wont take too much damage but anyone else can take quite a bit so if it is facing a dps/healer they should either dodge roll from it or simply block. Do NOT run around the room. This also staggers the target a bit so is a little annoying. Keep behind the boss at all times if you are a dps/healer and this wont be a problem.\n\n|cffff00Lightning splash|r - The boss will occasionally aim at a random target (so have your own dedicated positions so you know who he is targeting) and he will place a nasty aoe on the ground under the feet of his chosen target. Simple note WHO he is aiming at and then the target should move out of the aoe and avoid the damage while getting back into a suitable position. The reason you MUST get back into the fight asap is to prevent the charge attack due to being too far away. Basically get out of the trouble and then get  back into the fight again. Standing in the aoe WILL hurt a lot so don't stay in it for more than a second or two if you are not the tank.\n\n"

The tank should stay with the boss in the middle of the room and hold him still and watch for incoming banekins. The rest of the group should stay fairly close and watch for banekins also..they do hurt!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is a simple heavy attack. It is always aimed at the person who has agro and this should always be the tank however if it is on a dps/healer the same rules apply...BLOCK! do NOT run away!\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - He will occasionally spin his weapon around his head emitting a small aoe around himself. This does damage over time and should be avoided by the squishies but the tank should be fine with it. Again do NOT run away, just step out of it and you will be fine.\nNOTE: after she is dead don't forget to press the button in the room to lower the drawbridge to the next fight.\n\n|cffff00Exploding Banekins|r - At the start of the fight and during the fight periodically the boss will spawn exploding banekin adds, these do not have much health so if there is a lot of aoe damage down on the floor they CAN die when they spawn but be warned if they get CLOSE to a dps/healer they can almost and sometimes completely one shot a player. More than one blowing up at once is for sure certain death. The tank can with stand it but others cannot. When these spawn the tank should try to chain/pin them as soon as possible to prevent them running at the group. If you are a dps/healer and you ARE in trouble you can dodge roll to avoid them while they explode but don't run around the room if you can help it.\n\n"

There are lots of adds to start with so be sure your tank grabs them as fast as possible on top of the boss while holding the boss still. Setup a formation surrounding the boss (everyone has their own space) around the back of the boss away from the bosses face with the rest of the group. Pay CLOSE attention to his mechanics and do NOT run away!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Occasionally the boss will heavy attack the tank (or whoever has agro) simple block this and you will be fine but if not you WILL be knocked down and the domino affect of other mechanics hitting you while you are down can be a mess.\n\n|cffff00Ice blast|r - Watch for the spreading aoe effect that comes from underneath the boss! When this mechanic starts happening, get out of the area it is consuming/spreading too as soon as possible, it will hit really hard and apply a knock down. This mechanic is VERY important to get used to for the last boss.\n\n|cffff00Drain|r - The boss will pick a target to attach a draining affect beam to a chosen target (random) and the longer he holds the target in the air the more health he will gain back, you MUST break free from this! This is also very important to pay attention to for the last boss.\n\n|cffff00Blast|r - The boss periodically attempt to channel a cast timed ability which will launch a nasty blast in aoe of affect at a random target. This can be interrupted so pay close attention to this and it wont ever be a problem. However if it is cast, just move out of the way before it lands.\n\n"

The group should always stay behind the boss and this will prevent them from taking damage from his most effective attacks.\n\n|cffff00Cone aoe|r - This cone shaped affect aoe ability is always aimed in the direction of the person who has agro. This should be the tank. Simply block this and you will take minimal damage, however if you are a dps/healer and this is aiming at you (which it shouldn't be) simply block or step out of it. Remember you should NOT be in front of the boss if you are not the tank.\n\n|cffff00Ice blast|r - Watch for the spreading aoe effect that comes from underneath the boss! When this mechanic starts happening, get out of the area it is consuming/spreading too as soon as possible and once it is gone get back in again. It is similar to the last boss,  adds a knock back/stagger and does moderate damage.\n\n|cffff00Slam|r - The boss will smash the ground with his fist and a small aoe damage circle will appear under each player, after it bursts a large frost spike will come out of the ground and out of the spikes will spawn Draugr type enemies. They have very low health and are easy to kill quickly but if possible the tank should grab hold of them and/or pin them so they don't run wild. As dps and healers do NOT run away, they will just chase you and kill you in the back of the head. DON'T panic!\n\n"

Key points for this fight are to make sure you do not run around like a headless chicken, all find your own space and preserve your stamina, you WILL need it. Sprinting around the room will kill you and/or make this fight REALLY hard!. This boss can be debuffed but NOT taunted, she will hit who she likes, so the tank should keep up debuffs, grab adds and keep shields(if they have any) on the group. The tank is 'protect mode' for this fight.\n\n|cffff00Light Attacks|r - The boss will hit who she likes when she likes, this is why you all find your own positions to make sure you know WHO she is aiming at. Stacking up will make this impossible to tell. She will fire off frost light attacks at her chosen target, usually x3 in a row. These HURT! If you are the target, shield and block (if magicka) or block/dodge roll if you are stamina and you can afford the stamina to do so. The healer should focus the target and keep them up as 2 of these in a row without a heal WILL kill you.\n\n|cffff00Teleport and ice blast|r - When she teleports(periodically) she will spawn at a different location. Look for her fast and gauge where she is. The second she lands she will emit a very large aoe from under her and once it is at peak it will burst with ice shards from the ground. IF this hits a dps/healer, they are dead. One shot! (unless they have stupid high resists) avoid this at all costs and THEN get back into position.\n\n|cffff00Ice Wraiths|r - At 50% and under she will spawn ice wraiths (x2) every so often, these have nasty light attacks and can use a charge ability which will knock down players, these are easy to spot and should be avoided or blocked but above all this is where the tank comes in. While protecting the group, taunt these 2 and stick them on the boss. Aoe damage alone should be able to dispatch these fast. Remember do NOT run around the room, relax and keep up a formation so you can see the incoming attacks from the boss.\n\n|cffff00Ice Atronachs|r - Under 25% she will spawn 2x frost atronachs. They spawn spikes from the ground which should be avoided and they also attack with frontal cone attacks. The tank should treat these just like the wraiths and stack them on the boss so they can be killed with aoe. If they are on you and you are a dps/healer, just block and don't panic. Let the tank grab control of them and DON'T run around the room. They have low health so will not last long.\n\n|cffff00Drain!|r- This is what makes or breaks this dungeon!\nJust like Drodda's Apprentice she will target one player periodically...she will attach a beam to the target and every second will drain their health and heal herself. She heals a LOT!!! some groups find it almost impossible to kill her based on how much she heals per second so the KEY point to this mechanic is you MUST 'BREAK FREE!'. If you do not have enough stamina to do so you are in trouble!\nWhen the beam is on you, break free instantly! This is why you must preserve your stamina throughout the fight. This mechanic alone is the biggest problem. Stay in your formation so you can see who she is aiming at and deal with this problem as soon as possible! The most simple mechanic in the entire dungeon that can completely wreck a group. Have fun!\n\n"

This is where yoloers die on repeat. Be sure that the tank goes first and grabs as many adds as possible to take the pressure off the group. The boss can be fought in two ways. You can pull the adds in the entrance to the room separately in a small group away from the boss without getting her attention (which makes things pretty simple) or you can stack everything on the boss. The experience of the group would determine which one you are able to do. Safest of course is take your time.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is a very simple and common mechanic from most bosses. A typical heavy attack which must be blocked or you will be knocked down. Whether you are a Tank or not, if this is aimed at you...you MUST block it.\n\n|cffff00Scream|r - This is a cone shaped AOE in front of the boss. She will scream in the direction of the person with agro (hopefully the tank). The tank should turn her away from the group and be sure she is always staying still. The scream damage can be blocked but she does disorientate so if you are affected you must break free. If she is aiming at the dps /healer they CAN also block the main force of the damage but i would highly recommend simpley moving out of the cone so you don't get hit by it. This can hit very hard to a squishy and should be avoided as much as possible.\nThe group should be behind the boss and the tank in front of the boss to make this as simple as possible.\n\n"

The tank should hold the boss as still as possible facing away from the rest of the group and the group should stand behind the boss ready to move from certain mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Lightning strike|r - Occasionally the boss will cast a lightning ability that strikes the player and nearby allies with fork lightening from the sky. This only lasts about 3-4 seconds and increases his resists at the time too. This is a very weak attack so as long as heals are coming i, won't be a problem to the group. Don't run away...relax and keep focus on the fight.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Avatar|r - The boss will cast a reflection of himself in a lightning form. This can be taunted by the tank and should be held onto with the boss. Do not run around the room with it because it will make it really difficult to control if you do. Once the tank has control of it you should be safe to focus the boss while the reflection dies to AOE damage. The reflection has very low health so if controlled wont cause much of a problem.\n\n|cffff00Stun|r - Even with a taunt on the boss he can still sometimes aim at other players so be aware of your health. Occasionally he will randomly stun a player so be sure not to drop too low health while fighting else this can cause a problem if damage is hitting you while stunned. You can break free from this so some quick thinking is required if this happens to you.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Field|r - This ENORMOUS AOE will move back and forth throughout the whole fight. All you have to do is move out of the way of it when it comes to you and let it pass. Running around the room will become a massive problem. Frantic behavior will mean more damage will be taken and it is heard for the healer to keep up. Simply move to one side and get back to where you were again. This happens throughout the whole fight and if you get caught it will REALLY hurt. A tank should be fine but dps and healers need to be careful.\n\n"

There are a fair amount of adds in the room which need to be dealt with so if possibly the tank should stack them on the bosses feet and hold the boss as still as possible turning it AWAY from the group. Running around the room will cause problems so relax and find your feet. Keep an eye out for ranged adds especially the healer and the archer as they need to be interrupted from time to time.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is a simple heavy attack. The tank SHOULD have agro anyway so of course this should be blocked by the tank however... IF a dps or a healer ends up being targeted, so long as you make sure you block this attack you will be fine. If not you will fly across the room.\n\n|cffff00Whirlwind|r - Typical of most dual wield melee types this boss can spin the same as the whirlwind/steel tornado ability in a small AOE. The tank will be fine with this but as dps and healers you just need to be out of range of it. so about 5meters away or so and this wont hit you. But if you are up close and it is too late to move, simply block and you will mitigate the majority of the damage. Don't run just block.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Splash|r - The boss will periodically cast a small AOE of lightning on the floor, usually in the direction of whoever has agro (should be the tank but don't panic if it is not). All you need to do is simply walk out of it and find another safe position to stand in. The damage isn't too high but you certainly don't want to stand in it too long.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 STORMFIST |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is quite possibly the most fun encounter in this dungeon. He doesn't have too much health but one of the mechanics is a bit of a laugh if you 'accidentally' get caught (guilty, if i know it won't kill me i sometimes stand in it on purpose for fun..but i wouldn't recommend it until you have high resists!\nThe tank should position this boss in  the center and turn it away from the group and the rest of the group should stay behind the boss and NOT run around.\n\n|cffff00Fist|r - The boss will occasionally punch the ground and then a LARGE grabbing hand will spawn out of the ground into a fist and crush whoever is inside of it. The AOE of this is quite small and should be easy to step out of and avoid. This will stun but the tank can block it and/or break free if caught.\n\n|cffff00Minions|r - Periodically the boss will spawn smaller versions of himself. They do run quite fast so the tank needs to be on the ball with these  and grab them fast without moving the boss if possible. If they chase you as a dps or healer don't panic, they do not hurt much and the damage they throw can be blocked. So if they are on you, block for a bit until the tank has control and all should be fine. They die fast to AOE damage so do NOT run away.\n\n|cffff00Stomp!!|r - One of the most fun mechanics in the game in my opinion. The boss will raise his foot and a rapid spreading AOE will appear. Now this is very important. IF you are unfamiliar with the fight, new to the game and/or have low cps/resist..get out of this as fast as possible and then get back in again when it is gone. Co-ordination is key and if you get caught you will take a LOT of damage. This will throw you into the AIR! and stun you as well.\nBUT if i am honest, if you have high resists or around 300+ cps with well placed resist cps, you can survive it and it is a lot of fun to be flung up into the sky! note: you didn't read that here!\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - The boss enrages under 25% health. He will raise his hands and constantly burst in AOE with lightning damage every second causing massive damage! Don't try to run it won't save you. The tank should apply debuff from the taught and try to protect the group, the healer should go to town on the heals and keep people up, and the dps need to stay focused, plant their feet and do as much sustained damage as possible to kill it. IF people stop damage and if people stop healing and run around the room, you will all die. key word here...'FOCUS'.\n\n"

He is hard to spot in a crowd too so make sure you pay attention here. The tank needs to grab him as soon as possible but at the same time try to stack as many adds on him as possible so THEY can die in AOE from the group. The dps and healers should keep their eyes peeled for ranged interrupts for casters and archers etc. A simpler way to sort out this fight is to run in and grab some adds first off and burn them down with aoe while the boss comes to YOU. But that depends on your group. I personally would recommend building up ultimate on the trash before this room so that you can hit hard and fast.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will fire off a nasty heavy attack that will knock down and do a LOT of damage if you miss it so be sure to block this. This will be aimed at who ever has agro (should be the tank) but if it hits a dps or healer, make sure you are blocking. Do not panic, this room is VERY busy and those are easy to miss. Find your feet, and relax. The less running around you do the easier it is to see what is going on.\n\n|cffff00Levitate|r  - During the fight the boss will suspend a member of the group in mid air for around 5 seconds at most. This can be broken however. If you are the victim you can break free. And if you are not the victim you can bash/interrupt the boss and set your group member FREE!\n\n"

You must pay attention and you MUST co-ordinate. It is key that you watch your feet and her hands at all times! The tank should be taunting all the time of course but she WILL hit group members when she feels like it. Everyone should have their OWN space. Do not stack on each others feet else when she aims at YOU, you wont know that it is you and could be someone else instead (or vica versa) and it is incredibly difficult to react to the incoming damage.\nStand in a formation which clearly allows all 4 of you to have enough room to see if she is directly attacking you or someone else. Do not panic and stay close to her at all times unless mechanics prevent it, this is key...unless a certain mechanic happens (explained below) you MUST stay close!\nNote: running around the room on this boss is certain death.\n\n|cffff00Light Attacks|r - The boss will hit who she likes when she likes, this is why you all find your own positions to make sure you know WHO she is aiming at. Stacking up will make this impossible to tell. She will fire off frost light attacks at her chosen target, usually x3 in a row. These HURT! If you are the target, shield and block (if magicka) or block/dodge roll if you are stamina and you can afford the stamina to do so. The healer should focus the target and keep them up as 2 of these in a row without a heal WILL kill you. If you are low cp/resists and you do not block...you are pretty much dead. Although the boss maybe taunted she will do this to whoever she likes.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Strike|r - When the boss raises her hand she will call down a lightning strike. Pretty much a mages wrath. She will LOOK at the target she is going to hit, if this is you, you MUST block (with a damage shield if you are magicka as well if possible) This deals ridiculous damage and if you are not blocking this can pretty much wipe out anyone but a tank. Also if you are not full health at the time, it can act exactly like mages wrath and execute you in one hit. BE careful. Remember position is key you NEED to know who she is aiming at.\n\n|cffff00BURST!|r - This MASSIVE AOE is not only a one shot to anyone that isn't a tank but incredibly difficult to master if you are one of those 'run around the room' types or one of those 'i think i can make it ' types. Do NOT underestimate this mechanic because it ties in directly with the next one. She will start casting and a huge AOE will spread from under her feet. Get out of this as fast as possible and try to not run further than the very edge of the AOE. Once this reaches it's peek it will burst and unless you are a meaty tank, ANYONE caught inside it is dead! As soon as this is over you MUST get straight back into your previous position (formation around the boss close as possible) without hesitation!\n\n|cffff00Superman Punch!|r - No the ability is not called a 'superman punch' but it is appropriate. You will notice that i say stay near the boss at all times apart from the spreading AOE...then i note get back in ASAP! This is because if you are too far away from the boss, she will superman punch the person furthest a way and kill them in ONE SHOT!\nNever stay away from the boss. The previous mechanic with the AOE based on THIS mechanic means..get out and get back in again FAST\n\n|cffff00Wind|r - This is a VERY important mechanic and you must have your eyes all over the place to keep track of it. There are winds/clouds/smoke whatever you want to call them, moving around the room. The longer the fight the more of these spawn and they are REALLY difficult to manage. If you get hit by them they will knock you back staggering you for a second and also deal damage. So you have to move around them.\nHere is where it becomes a problem. IF the boss is doing her burst AOE mechanic and you move out of it (even in a dodge roll) and you catch a wind cloud, it will stagger you and push you back IN to the AOE. Meaning you are dead. If you get hit by the wind as she is starting her AOE you wont have time to get out and you are dead. IF you get hit by one while you escape the AOE you will be staggered and too far from her for too long and she will superman punch you meaning you are dead. And finally if you get hit by these during her light attack and/or her lightning splash you will take enough damage to make the next incoming attack one shot you...meaning (you guessed it) you are dead!\nThe damage from the clouds are not huge but these need to be avoided at all costs because they really mess with your performance and ability to complete the fight. So whenever you have to avoid a mechanic, LOOK around you and be careful. Don't panic and watch your feet.\n\nRecap: Stay close, block if she focuses you, get out of the AOE, get straight back IN again...avoid the wind, and for goodness sake do NOT run around the room panicking. GOOD LUCK!\n\n"

There is a main boss (Desert Lion) and 4x lioness adds. The tank should grab the adds as soon as possible and stack them on the boss. If you are a dps or healer do NOT run around the room because a lion is trying to eat you, just get close to the tank so he/she can gain agro. The adds will die to aoe quickly as they are low health and then you can focus the boss.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is a very simple and common mechanic from most bosses. A typical heavy attack which must be blocked or you will be knocked down. Whether you are a Tank or not, if this is aimed at you...you MUST block it.\n\n|cffff00Roar|r - Occasionally the boss will change positions making the fight a little bit mobile and also he will ROAR! This does exactly what you would expect a lion's roar to do, and it FEARS the group. You will run a random direction uncontrollable for about 3 seconds and he WILL jump someone in the back. SO as soon as you see this mechanic make sure you break free and get back into position. This is why you should keep an eye on your resources. Make sure you have enough stamina at all times to break free if and when you need to.\n\nDuring the fight the dps and the healer should position themselves away from the front of the boss and for the most part stand still. There is no other dangerous mechanics happening. Tank needs to hold a taunt and the group should burn the boss as best they can\n\n"

Phase one he is a melee type with a two hander, phase two he is a mage with lots of fire damage, and then finally he calls down a gargoyle to finish you off!\nThe initial approach to the fight can be rough as there are many adds to kill and he jumps in mid fight. So make sure your tank holds everything central while the dps focus on as much aoe as possible. The tank needs to be quick off the mark however in order to taunt the boss when he lands in the\n\n|cffff00Phase 1|r - Warrior - The boss will heavy attack with his two handed weapon at whoever has agro. This should be the tank since the tank is the one with the taunt, however if you are a dps or healer do NOT panic and do NOT run away. Simply block and you will be fine. But if you miss it then it will knock you down.\nOccasionally he will also do a whirlwind like attack spinning his weapon around his head. As a dps or healer you MUST stay out of this as it deals a LOT of physical damage. No need to run around, just move out of it and wait for it to finish.\n\n|cffff00Phase 2|r - Mage - The boss will alter completely now using a flame staff. He throws out constantly light attacks in the form of a fire ball and the tank should be the only one getting hit so long as he/she is maintaining a taunt. If you get agro as a dps or healer just block until agro is regained and you will be fine.\nHis heavy attack will put a LARGE fire aoe on the ground, stay OUT of this. This will kill you rapidly so just watch your feet. Also finally the boss will cast a flame spirit affect on the tank fearing it. So if you are the tank keep enough stamina in your pool so that you can break free when this happens.\n\n|cffff00Phase 3|r - Gargoyle - As the boss is about to die he will call down a monstrous gargoyle. He is not as scary as he looks. Get your tank to position him in the middle of the room, while the dps and healer find a nice safe spot to do their job without running away or around. The gargoyle will attack the tank (or whoever has agro) with a flurry attack. Most tanks will be able to stand up to this but if not simply block, same goes for other roles too, blocking is fine.\nThe gargoyle will breath on a random player (do NOT stack up) and turn them to stone. This can be broken free from so be sure to have enough stamina at all times in case YOU are the target. After the first breath he will slam the ground like crazy and you MUST get out of it until he has finished. Then the fight repeats making it so he flurries, does 2x breaths then a slam. Rinse repeat. Keep out of his face if you are a dps/healer and you will be fine.\n Remember to step OUT of the slam.\n\n"

Firstly there are 4 adds, the tank should stack these on the boss and each other member of the group should find a nice position around the boss where they are not in his face. The adds will die to aoe damage as they are very weak. Now it is time to focus the boss damage wise and pay attention!\n\n|cffff00Teleport|r - Just like assassin beetles this boss can teleport, be careful and be sure to block when this happens and get ready to move. the initial hit hurts but he usually follows it up with his next attack.\n\n|cffff00Fire Blast|r - The boss will stop in his tracks and a spreading aoe will grow from underneath him.\nUnlike most spreading aoes this does NOT just cause damage when it explodes. This actually pules fire damage every second until it explodes at maximum size. If you do NOT get out of this as a dps or a healer you are dead. It hits incredibly hard and you must get out of it as soon as possible. The tank should be able to stand up to it but the rest will not.\nOnce this mechanic is over, get back in position and continue to attack.

He doesn't even hit that hard to be honest but of course it is always safer to follow the mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Tail Whip|r - occasionally the boss will put out a ROAR and turn to his side. When he does this a cone aoe will happen and he will whip his tail. This will be in the direction of the tank or whoever has agro. You have two options here, block it, or move out of it. Either option is fine but if you fail it you will be knocked down on the ground.\n\n|cffff00Burrow|r - This mechanic is actually quite fun. The boss will burrow into the ground and randomly choose a victim. Whoever he has chose will have an erupting aoe appear under them and he will burst out of the ground doing damage to anyone caught in the aoe. This doesn't hurt very much really but you should dodgeroll or run out of it as soon as this happens and then get back into position.\nThe tank should always be in the bosses face and the dps/healer should always be behind/beside the boss.\nDo not run around the room else the burrow mechanic can get a bit hectic.

The room is small and he attacks FAST. The tank should hold the boss and the adds all together while the group find a nice position for their feet without running around.\n\n|cffff00lightning|r - The boss ire a lightning shot along the floor. You will see a small circle aoe aiming at you or another member of the group, you CAN block this but it is safer to just move to one side and let it pass.\n\n|cffff00Spin|r - This attack is done on the spot, he will stand still and spin his torso. This does cause nasty physical damage but if you are about 3-5meters out of range OR blocking you will be just fine.\n\n|cffff00Slam|r  - During the fight the boss will go into a ball shape and jump in the air slamming the ground. There will be a small aoe under his feet so stay out of it. Very simple to avoid this one as it is only about 3 meters wide.\n\n|cffff00Bomb|r - one member of the group occasionally will get a large aoe under their feet. This is a bomb and if you run into the group you will blow them up. Step back, block and/or shield and you will be fine. DO NOT run around, step back so you do not kill your group.\n\n"

Remember the boss in Darkshade caverns I where he had 3 different phases? well NOW you are fighting all 3 phases at once as 3 individual targets!\nThis requires communication and awareness of the mechanics of the different constructs. They share a health bar so it doesn't matter which one you kill first. However if you can manage to stack them occasionally, they will take additional damage. Each one you are hitting contributes to the overall damage being taken. However that is not as simple as it sounds because one of them can go completely rouge.\n\n|cffff00Blue Boss|r - This one will stay fairly still for the majority of the fight, if the tank can taunt it for a debuff that would be preferable but sometimes that is not possible so do not panic. This boss will aim his cannon into the air and cause lightning blasts to land on the ground, just watch your feet and move away from them before they land and you will be fine. you do not have to sprint around like mad, just move a bit each time one is coming down from the sky and prevent it from hitting you.\n\n|cffff00Yellow Boss|r - This one can be a nightmare if people underestimate it or get selfish and start running at their team. This CAN be taunted and will follow the tank so long as the tank does not drop the taunt. This one has a heavy attack called'decapitate'. It is a cone aoe in front of him and anyone caught in it, if not a tank, will die in pretty much one shot. You can block it and you can dodge roll backwards but do NOT dodge or run in the direction of your team. This can hit as many people as it can hit in the aoe and the aoe follows you when you dodge roll. DON'T spin the boss onto your friends. This boss will also occasionally try to heal the others. Some groups like to take this boss to one side of the room while the others are being dealt with. But if you are a strong tank, you can stack it on top of the blue one.\n\n|cffff00?Red Boss|r - This is the fun one. He can be taunted with a debuff but he cannot be taunted to gain agro when he is spinning. This boss will decide on a target and chase them spinning like mad. If you are caught in the spin you will be snared and take rapid high physical damage ticks and die incredibly fast. if this boss is on you, take him away and run in a circle until he stops. You can kite him around where the damage is being done(in aoes for extra damage) BUT not at the expense of your group, do not choo choo train through your own group.\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\n"

It is VERY important that you take the boss into the room and back yourself into a corner or against a wall. NO ONE should be having their back to the door way. Dps, healer and tank must stay clear of the door. Aoe should be more than enough to.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - A simple heavy attack, the damage is low but it does apply a knock down if not blocked. This will be aimed at whoever has agro (should be the tank). If you are not a tank and he is aiming at you, simply block and you will be fine. Do NOT run away.\n\n|cffff00Whirlwind|r - Occasionally the boss spin his weapon around his head dealing aoe physical damage to anyone near by. This does a fair bit of damage but is not challenging to a tank. All dps and healer types should simply step out of the circle until the affect is finished. Don't run around the room and don't stand in it, just step back, then step back in again.\n\n|cffff00Spin Kick|r - This is the most important mechanic and this is WHY you must have your back against the wall at all times. The boss will do a jumping spin kick randomly at a player in the group. You can block the incoming damage but this kick WILL send you flying! The reason you have your back against the wall at all times is because if you don't, the distance you travel from the kick is enough to throw you OFF the platform outside from inside the room. If this happens you are pretty much dead, it is a LONG way down.\n\n"

Try to position him as central as possible while each member of the group has their own space. Stacking up will cause a problem and so will running around, so relax and find your feet.\n\n|cffff00Acid Puke|r - his is a cone aoe affect and the boss basically pukes for a few second, damaging anyone in his path. Be sure to stay out of this at all costs unless you are the tank in which case hold him still and block it.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - The boss will charge across the room, usually in the direction the tank has his/her back to. He runs a very long way so be sure to reposition yourselves once he stops. The aoe effect is VERY easy to see, a long strip across the floor. If you stand in it you will take a large amount of damage and be knocked down. So simply step aside when you see this and let him pass.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - The boss will stomp the floor from time to time and a fairly large aoe circle will appear. Anyone caught in it will take a large amount of damage and be knocked down. Be sure to simply step backwards out of this when it happens and then just get back into position again when it is gone. Note, there is NO need to sprint around the room when this happens. Step out, step in.\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - The boss grow massive in size at 30% health or lower and will heal  back up to 50% health. The rest of the mechanics will stay the same but he becomes MUCH bigger. Be careful!\n\n"

There are harpies that need to be chained in and killed with aoe but at the same time there is a very important attack to pay attention to. The tank should hold the boss as still as possible while the dps and healer find a safe place to stand still and get to work. Do NOT run around the room, you need to be able to see what is going on here.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Does exactly as it says on the tin. The heavy attack can be blocked and will hit the tank or whoever has agro. No matter what role you are, if this is on you, BLOCK IT. If you don't you will be knocked down and take HUGE damage.\n\n|cffff00Whirlwind|r - Basically a steel tornado attack, the boss will spin and anyone caught in the small aoe around it will take physical damage. This is very easy to avoid, when you see the spin coming, step back a couple of feet, and when it is over step back in again.\n\n|cffff00Shadow Volley|r - THIS IS DANGEROUS! The boss will start channeling with a purple glow in it's hands. This is fast and MUST be interrupted. IF you do not interrupt this then each member of the group will receive a massive damage magic projectile to the face and if not packing high resists can EASILY be one shotted. Make SURE you interrupt this mechanic. Doing so will make the boss very easy, not doing it will result in wipe after wipe. Hold it still, burn it down and interrupt whenever you see that purple glow.\n\n"

The trick to this boss is careful positioning. She moves around a lot so you have to constantly regroup formation. The tank needs to keep a taunt on her at all times while the rest need to watch their feet rather than headless chicken mode. NOTE: The dps and healer should NEVER stand in the bosses face unless of course they are extremely comfortable with the fight.\n\n|cffff00Fire Tornado|r - This attack will be aimed at the tank so be sure the tank always has agro. It deals a LOT of damage so the dps and healer do NOT want to be hit by this. Make sure you are not standing in her face.\n\n|cffff00Teleport|r - he boss will teleport around the room a LOT, keep up with her each time she moves and focus on getting back in your previous formation in the new spot.\n\n|cffff00Flame Breath|r - This HUGE aoe flame breath affect does exactly as you would expect. The boss breathes fire in the direction of whoever has agro. You can step out of this and/or block some of the damage as a tank, but as adps/healer you need to be NO WHERE near it. Stay OUT of this at all costs and don't dance in the boss's face.\n\n|cffff00Raining Fire|r - This mechanic she will scream into the sky launching fireballs into the air. At this point people need to stand still because the position you are currently standing in is where they will land. While she is screaming she is placing the aoe's locations. When they come down from the sky THAT is when you move out of the way, then reposition yourselves once the mechanic is over. It is crucial that you hold your ground until they come back down else you will scatter the room in aoe and kill your group!\nRunning around while she is firing into the air will determine far too many locations where you JUST RAN and the aoes will be placed all over the place following your previous path. Calm down, don't run.\n\n"

The tank should turn the boss to face the door while the group stand behind it. So long as you stay behind the boss at all times, this really isn't hard to manage. The room full of adds before the boss is actually harder to deal with!\n\n|cffff00Ice Attack|r - The boss throws ice in the direction of the person with agro (should be the tank) and then the area which was affected will have small patches of ice on the ground which do damage over time. Do not stand in front of the boss of course if you are a dps or healer but if you are caught by this affect it is not challenging at all. The damage is low and any healer would be able to keep up with it.\n\nBUT of course follow the mechanics. Stay behind the boss, do your damage and/or heals and the tank should maintain a taunt.

In this fight you can tank him where he spawns. All you have to do is hold him still. The tank should turn his/her back to the water and have the boss standing still while the group surround the boss from behind. DO NOT run around like crazy it will kill you.\n\n|cffff00Skeletons|r - The boss will spawn up to 6 skeletons at a time constantly throughout the fight. Any melee types will run in and die to standard aoe damage but the ranged ones will try to hug the water. Without moving if possible the tank should be angling the camera at each one while holding a taunt on the boss and simply chain them in. The skeletons have REALLY low health so die very fast in aoe but can do some serious damage if not pulled in fast enough. Get em in FAST!\n\n|cffff00Spin|r - The boss has a nasty spin attack in a small aoe. This does high physical damage but is very easy to avoid. The tank can block it and take barely any damage and the dps/healer can block also, but there is really no need. As soon as you see this mechanic as a NON tank role, simply step out of it, and then get back in again.\n\n|cffff00Skeleton Curse!!|r - RANDOMLY the boss will pick a member of the group and slam them onto the ground. That member will be cursed and turned into a skeleton for 30seconds! This could be the tank, the healer OR the dps it is completely random. When you are a skeleton you cannot use ANY abilities. The only thing you can do is light or heavy attack. The light attack is a melee attack and the heavy attack is a constant 'Death Breath'. Stay in with the group, follow the mechanics as normal and hold heavy attack to breathe on the skeletons and the boss to do damage. You can still receive buffs and heals but apart from that you are rendered useless class/role wise. Do what you can and PRAY! If the healer gets turned into a skeleton, you will get no heals, so magickas and staminas need shields and heals slotted to close the gaps. If the tank gets turned there will be NO taunt on the boss...If this happens for goodness sake do NOT run around the room. Block any damage the boss throws at you if you are a dps/healer and continue to do your job while the transformation runs out.\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\n"

IF you are hit by this you will fly an extremely long way in the air, way off the platform you are fighting him on. All you have to do is simply dodge roll or walk out of the aoe cone and you will be unharmed.\n\n|cffff00Fear|r - This is exactly what it says on the tin. Every so often the boss will roar at the group fearing all members into running random directions from the boss for 3-4 seconds. All you need to do in this phase is break free. So long as your maintain your stamina resource for the majority of the fight you will (or should) be able to instantly break free when he fears you. Careful after breaking however because he CAN throw out his Slam Attack straight after to try to get some big hits on the running targets.\n\n"

Close ranged and long ranged. The group should stay generally central for the waves of enemies and the tank should try to chain/pull in as many ranged as possible so the group can dispatch them fast with aoe damage. Once all waves are dead the 4x bosses will jump into the room. The tank should bring all x4 together and hold them still and try NOT to make any of them face the group.\nNOTE: these bosses CAN be chained, stunned, rooted, cc'd AND health potions will appear on the floor in the fight which you can pick up if you need.\n\n|cffff00Snagg Gro-Mashul|r - This boss has an aoe whirlwind like affect from his 2handed weapon, this is small and very easy to avoid by stepping out of it while it is happening. He also heavy attacks with an uppercut so be sure to block this.\n\n|cffff00Nusana|r - The boss ill occassoinally cast a nasty line of fire across the floor, this is easy to avoid by simply moving to one side and letting it pass, but if it hits you it will REALLY hurt. Keep your eyes open.\n\n|cffff00Dynus Aralas|r - The boss will cast fire and ice abilities including some cc, so be sure to make sure you keep a close eye on this boss so that heals and damage channeling abilities can be bashed/interrupted.\n\n|cffff00Kayd at-Sal|r - The boss is like a traditional rogue type, fast attacks and cna make mince meat of a dps. This boss above ALL should be focused and your tank must NOT drop a taunt on this one. He is slippery. If you are a dps and this guy focuses you, stay close to the tank so the tank can regain agro and be sure to block the incoming attacks.\n\nALL bosses at 30% turn into werewolves with flurry, heavy attack and pounce knock back abilities.\n\n"

Also in the beginning there are 2 Enraged Durzogs to deal with. If the tank positions the boss facing away from the group and pins down the two Durzogs, they should die to aoe while the boss gradually takes damage. Hold the boss as still as possible.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Does exactly as it says on the tin. The heavy attack can be blocked and will hit the tank or whoever has agro. No matter what role you are, if this is on you, BLOCK IT. If you don't you will be knocked down and take HUGE damage.\n\n|cffff00Whirlwind|r - Basically a steel tornado attack, the boss will spin and anyone caught in the small aoe around it will take physical damage. This is very easy to avoid, when you see the spin coming, step back a couple of feet, and when it is over step back in again.\n\n|cffff00Exploding Banekins|r - Throughout the fight Banekins will appear and run at the group, when they get to their target they will explode! This is incredibly dangerous for the dps and these need to be managed. The aoe damage can sometimes be enough to kill them before they are a problem but if not the tank can also pin them while they are trying to run off.\nThe safest way to manage this above all is to be sure that the dps and healers are of course behind the boss but not too close (unless melee built) this way the banekins have longer to run and could die before they reach you. However if they do reach you, simply block and/or put up a damage shield and you will be fine.\n\n"

Your tank needs to pay close attention to these fights and be sure that anything taunted is faced AWAY from the group. DPS and Healers need to focus here because running around the room WILL kill you.\n\n|cffff00Incineration Bettles|r - 4x nasty flaming beetles. The tank should try to hold these as still as possible. AOE damage all 4 of them at the same time as much as possible to kill them quickly and evenly. The beetles throughout the fight especially low health will cast a nasty pulsing fire aoe (which burns a LOT) and also place aoe on the ground (more fire) standing in this will be a MESS! Do NOT stand in it and your healer needs to really be on point for the incoming damage if people get caught. The beetles have low health but they can wipe groups. Be careful.\n\n|cffff00Stinger|r - This boss is incredibly simple. The tank should face it away from the group, in the mean time block any heavy attacks that come in. When the boss puts his stinger into the ground, one player will be targeted and poison will shoot out from under them to kill them, simply move away from this and do as you were doing. Do not sprint around the room, just move a bit and carry on.\n\n|cffff00The Troll King|r - This HUGE and if you understand him he is a bit of a puppy, BUT if you panic and run around the room, you will wipe. Tip..STAY CLOSE!!!\n\n|cffff00JUMP|r - This mechanic is simple, if you are too  far away from the boss he will jump on your head. STAY CLOSE\n\n|cffff00Slam|r - The boss will hit the ground with a huge slam and be very easy to spot with a large AOE visual. Simple block or step out of it, BUT make sure you get back in position asap so that he doesn't jump at long ranged targets.\n\n"

This will give the boss a damage shield.\nSo long as you kill the Flame atronach the boss's damage shield will disappear. This is VERY relevant and important to the next boss fight. Remember, when you kill a flame atronach they explode, so don't stand where they died.\n\n"

There is a lot going on and pretty much everything you can see will kill you, Lava kills, fire kills, pools of lava on the floor etc are all dangerous. Tiny pools are not there for fun or part of the scenery, they are HIGH damage areas and you are NOT meant to stand in them. So watch your feet!\nThe tank should put the boss as central as possible without standing in the lava and get ready for a world of pain. do NOT drop the boss!\nFor all group members, you must find your positions and focus. do NOT dance around the room, you WILL die and it is very hard to recover.\n\n|cffff00Atronachs|r - Just like the last boss, atronachs will spawn. During this fight the lesser her health the more atronachs spawn. They will attach a beam to her and render her IMMUNE to ALL damage until the atronachs are dead. You MUST focus those atronachs BUT be sure to follow mechanics because these can overlap with other phases.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The boss as a very hard hitting heavy attack! If you block this you will take barely any damage (even a dps can survive) BUT if you miss it, you will fly a LONG way and she will follow up with other light attacks while you are on the ground. The heavy is also delayed animation wise, so be sure that you block as soon as you see her winding it up. It will hit you way before the animation has finished.\n\n|cffff00Eruptions|r - randomly during the fight lava pools will erupt and fire into the room, watch your feet and avoid these. They are small aoe but they do hurt a lot!\n\n|cffff00Flame attack|r - randomly the boss will fire flame light attacks at the group, usually at the furthest target. So keep your shields up and/or block when you see this coming.\n\n|cffff00The Wheel!|r - From a birds eye view this looks like spokes of a wheel. She will stab her sword into the ground and erupt several fast moving lines of fire from her to the edge of the area. These are random in direction but they will constantly fire until she stands up again.\nThe trick to this is range! Staying close makes it impossible to have enough time to react. As soon as you see her stab the floor, move backwards and get as much safe distance as possible, watch the flame on the floor and if it is aiming at you,m simply move left and right to avoid it.\nOnce the phase is over, get back in again. Getting hit by this will ONE shot a dps or a healer, so spread out, dodge the attacks and come back in...simple..effective, but done wrong, it is devastating.\nTaking off vampire wont save you...THIS will one shot anyone but a tank, and even most of those will die vampire or not. Watch your feet!\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

On approach you will be greeted with MANY adds and the tank should try to position these in the middle with the boss. Aoe damage should be more than enough to kill the adds but be sure the boss is of course taunted although not the primary target to damage at this point. Once all the adds are down it is time for the group to focus the boss and stand in a nice clean circle. Everyone should have their own space so you can see exactly what is going on.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - Occasionally the boss cleave with an aoe attack, this is very simple to avoid and all you really have to do is step out of it.

During this phase several ravens will attack the group in aoe which isn't too strong. Once the pull in and stun has faded the group should get back into positions and keep heals and damage up. This is a very simple boss and the damage incoming really isnt that strong, but running around the room will make a mess so be sure again to just circle the boss while the tank holds the boss still and you won't have a problem.\n\n"

The tank should grab the cats asap and the group need to kill them with aoe as fast as possible. Once dead the boss will shortly come down from the tree. DO NOT shoot with projectiles at the boss because they will be reflected back at you. After the shield has faded he will come down and the fight begins. Be sure that the tank keeps a taunt(even a ranged on) on the boss at all times.\n\n|cffff00Panthers|r - Spirit versions of the 4 panthers will spawn during the fight and they will re-spawn every time one dies, so it helps if you DON'T kill the panthers and the tank just holds them to one side away from the group while trying to keep a ranged taunt on the boss.\n\n|cffff00Volley|r - The boss will cast a volley attack throughout the fight, this is a small aoe which does a LOT of damage and should be avoided simply by taking a step out of it. there is NO need to run around like a headless chicken, if you are not standing in it, you are safe, simple.\n\n|cffff00Poison|r - The boss will cast poison clouds throughout the fight. These are quite large and do high damage over time but just like the volley can be avoided very easily by moving to one side.\n\n|cffff00Agility|r - This is a very agile boss and he loves to move around the room.

Some common sense should be applied here. Don't stand in it.\n\n|cffff00Hoavors|r - Throughout the fight small Hoavors will spawn near the boss and attack the group. These are incredibly low health and standard to low aoe damage is more than enough to kill them. Do not run away as this will not help. keep doing what you are doing and let the tank pin the targets so they can be controlled and killed quickly.\n\n"

There are mechanics to follow but they are very straight forward and obvious to spot.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - The boss will stomp and do damage in a small frontal aoe attack. Anyone caught in this will take a LOT of damage, if you are a tank you can block it but dps and heals should step out of this. BUT lets face it no one but the tank should be standing in front of the boss!\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - Every time the boss stomps more and more stranglers spawn in the room, they barely do anything at all, although they look scary. Just don't damage them and they won't interact with you.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - This HUGE straight line AOE attack is very easy to spot. Just like sword and board enemies, the boss will charge in a straight line until he hits the edge of the area. You can block this but there is no need, it is so huge and obvious you should be able to have plenty of time to just step out of it. move away, let the boss pass then continue taking him down where he finishes his charge.\n\n|cffff00Roar|r - Occasionally the boss will roar and the group will be feared into random directions. This lasts about 2-3 seconds and you loose all control of your character you run away.\nHowever you can break free of this. So all you have to do is keep enough stamina through out the fight to break and this will never be a problem. Very similar to the lion boss at the beginning of Volenfell.\n\nAbove all the boss will move around so the tank should stand in front, the group should stand behind and each time the boss moves, move with him and get back into formation. Despite his size this is a very slow sluggish and easy boss to kill.\n\n"

She has very low health and her attacks CAN deal a lot of damage but there is a little trick to this boss which makes things a lot easier...INTERRUPT!\n\n|cffff00Spiders|r - he boss will constantly call down many many small spiders into the fight. So long as you have lots of aoe damage down on the floor (even low aoe) they will die fast, they are really squishy.\n\n|cffff00Shock|r - The boss can cast shock aoe effects which do hit pretty hard but this can be interrupted so you never have to deal with it so long as you are on point with your interrupts.\n\n|cffff00Curse|r - The boss will cast a single target curse type dot on a target of her choice, BUT this is incredibly easy to avoid since you can either dodge roll it OR interrupt her.\n\nThis boss's attacks can constantly be interrupted so as long as you keep an eye on these and stop her from firing off her abilities she can cause almost NO threat to the group. BUT if you are not on point the attacks can hurt a lot. Keep your eyes open for that flashing red telegraph/sparks type image and bash/interrupt her when you need to.\n\n"

There are two phases but one attack in particular can cause the group to wipe. I have seen this done wrong repeatedly in pick up groups so hopefully this helps fix that. The boss should ALWAYS be faced away from the rest of the group. So the tank must hold a taunt and the direction of the boss 100% of the time.\n\n|cffff00Phase 1 (spider)|r - Selene starts as a giant spider and her attacks are similar to that of an average spider, with some nasty heavy attacks. The group should be BEHIND the boss in a semi circle while the tank keeps the boss facing away from them. Once she goes low health she will pull everyone in and drag the group through the web and lower into the ground. Once there you will have to push her to ALMOST death.\n\n|cffff00Phase 2 (Selene)|r - This is her more Humanoid form and a LOT of mechanics start to take place. Position your group in a semi circle around the boss, do NOT run around the room, focus, and the tank should always face the boss AWAY from the group!\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - Two hander, archers and healer mobs will spawn around the room. The two handers have a nasty habit of heavy attacking (uppercutting) group members so your tank should chain these in fast and control them. If you get heavy attacked you MUST block. Healers and archers should be interrupted while the tank tries to pull them in without spinning the boss.\n\n|cffff00Panther spirit|r - IF you are too far away from the group, rather than the jump mechanic that a lot of bosses have, the panther will be summoned to that group member and hit them with an 'unavoidable' attack. You should be blocking if this is aiming for you to mitigate the damage.\n\n|cffff00Webs/ravens|r - Just like the first boss you will be all pulled into the middle together and ravens/bats (are they ravens or bats?) will swarm in a large AOE. These do a lot of damage so as soon as the webs have dropped you must leave the damage circle. Instead of running around the room however, usually in a semi circle the left and right group member will be switched (so they are standing on opposite sides to which they once were. Use this as a tactical advantage and simply move out of the circle on the side you are NOW on rather than criss crossing about to get back where you were. relax, get back into the semi circle formation and you will be fine.\n\n|cffff00BRAVE STAR! (bear attack)|r -  call this the brave star attack. Basically just like the Selene's monster set a bear (foulhide spirit) will spawn from Selenes feet and it will heavy attack in aoe in front of her...it is CRUCIAL that you do NOT spin the boss around during this attack else it WILL hit the group and one shot them. A VERY tanky tank can block this, but if you are a squishy tank, simply move to the side, let it pass and get back in. NEVER spin the boss!\n\nGood luck!"

This boss CAN be killed very fast due to it's low health BUT if his fatal mechanic kicks in, the  group can KILL the one with the boss agro. BE CAREFUL! The fight is fairly simple in regards to tanking, grab the boss, turn it away from the group and keep it still. Kill the adds FIRST then focus on the boss.\n\n|cffff00Light attack|r - A very simple light attack which will hit the person with the agro (should be the tank) this is very light damage and even a dps/healer can take a slap or two, not too much to worry about but multiples of course can add up.\n\n|cffff00Frozen Torrent|r - This is identical to most Wraith type enemies, an ice aoe will aim at the target and freeze their feet on the spot doing a lot of damage. A tank can take it but a dps will loose up to 70% of their health depending on their resists and cp allocation so be careful, note, this is interruptible!\n\n|cffff00Drain Life|r - This is what gets people killed. This life draining beam will attach to a random player and drain their life BUT the damage is based on the damage he TAKES! You used to be able to break with a dodge roll but you no longer can, you can break with range however if you get away far enough BUT the fundamental problem with this is over burning...basically at this point all dps players should STOP DAMAGING THE BOSS! Wait for the beam to finish and then carry on...all damage done by the group is transferred to the player with the beam,. so YES you can kill your own group. Be careful!\n\n"

The tank should hold her still and face her away from the group and the group WILL need to co-ordinate to make this a quick and clean kill as there is a stifling mechanic coming up which will render a player useless...HELP your team!\n\n|cffff00Wave Attack|r - This boss will occasionally cast a flame type aoe in front of her which issues a slight knock back and strong damage. This should normally be aimed at the tank but if not, simple block it or move to the side to avoid it.\n\n|cffff00Levitation/stifle|r - The boss will pick a random player and suspend them in mid air rendering them completely helpless. They can do nothing, they cannot break free nor use any abilities. The trick to this is there will be 4x healing orbs/feasts heading towards the boss. If they reach her she will heal BUT if you destroy them ALL, you will release your group member from the spell. Do this FAST or else that team mate will be in some serious trouble, especially if it is the healer or the tank!\n\n"

Half way through the adds the boss usually walks into the room! Get ready!\n\n|cffff00Slam|r - The boss will cast a frontal aoe ability like a slam. So long as the tank is turning the boss away from the group the group will be safe and the tank will be required to block it. It is not too strong but if you are caught you will be knocked back. So be sure to block it.\n\n|cffff00Skeletons|r - Throughout the fight the boss will spawn skeletons from his feet (3x at a time) kill these fast or else they will explode and do aoe damage, much like the boss in Banished Cells I.\n\n|cffff00Charge!|r - Try to face the boss towards a wall or pillar. The reason for this is he will charge across the room (much like the leviathan in Crypt of Hearts I) and will keep running till he feels like stopping or hit a wall. When he charges he will knock down anyone in his path and leave behind a trail of mine type aoes which must be avoided. Remember this is about positioning, if you can get him to face a wall CLOSE to you, his charge will be short, if you are facing empty space, he will run a long way and the dps will constantly have to keep re-applying their damage and waste resources on ground based aoes and abilities.\n\n"

BUT if you do not block it you will be knocked down.\n\n|cffff00Overheat|r - The boss will cast a charged up like ability and hit with a nasty frontal aoe affect, this is pretty harsh but can be blocked and should be kept away from the group. Remember the tank should always turn the boss away from the team. DPS and healers should NOT stand in this aoe!\n\n|cffff00Lava Trails|r - During the whole fight there will be 2 snaking lava trails moving around the room. These do quite a lot of damage and should be avoided as much as possible. They have a habit of chasing players to make you move around a lot. Remember to stay behind the boss regardless of distance so you don't get hit by HIM but while avoiding these lava trails there is a little trick you can do to make things easier...\nFOLLOW the TAIL of the lava trails and the head will never catch you :)\n\n"

The tank should turn this boss AWAY from the group so that his aoes don't'  hit them. There are many adds in the room and they should be pulled into the middle as much as possible so that they can be killed with aoe while focusing the boss. HOWEVER you do not have to kill or even agro all of the mobs at once. If you walk straight through the middle of the room or even sneak around on the way to the boss, you won't agro the really far ranged ones and this will make the fight much easier.\n\n|cffff00Flame Breath|r - This doesn't take a lot of common sense to figure out but this is the flame breath a typical Deadroth uses. It will be cast in the direction of the player with the agro and this can be either stepped aside from, OR blocked. If you are a dps or healer you do NOT want to get hit with this.\n\n|cffff00Fireball spit|r - Like traditional Deadroths he will spit fire and place aoes on the ground after they impact. If you see this coming, simply block it, if you get caught with it you will be knocked down. Break free as fast as possible and get OUT of the fire!\n\n"

The key to this is that the tank MUST face it away from the group. Most of the dangerous stuff is in front of him. As a dps or healer do NOT stand in his face!\n\n|cffff00Beam|r - A green trident shaped triple beam which closes in on the target in the form of a frontal aoe. This does HIGH damage to squishies and anyone caught in it will be knocked off balance and will be required to break free. Avoid this at all costs as a dps/healer, the tank should be fine and if done properly the tank will be the only one that receives this.\n\n|cffff00Spin|r - The spin  attack is a nasty one and does high damage in aoe. As dps and healers you can move away from this OR keep doing what you are doing with high health upkeep. So long as the heals are coming in this should be fine but if you are not max health when this hits, you run the risk of dying. So HP maintenance is key.\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - With low health the bosses aoe damage escalates so at low health keep up the heals and execute it as fast as you can to prevent this from being a problem.\n\n"

He has low health and some LARGE aoe abilities so make sure you pay attention to this. The tank should keep it dead center while the group stay as close as possible (while watching out for mechanics). If everyone stays close but has their OWN SPACE, not stacking on each others feet, it is easy to see who is about to be focused.\n\n|cffff00Breath|r - This is a flame breath ability in a HUGE straight line aimed at ONE player, The target is random so hence why we have our own positions. Once you can see who it is going to hit, that player simply needs to move to the side and let it pass.  It will remain on the floor so don't stand in it.\n\n|cffff00Jump/slam|r - The ill jump straight up in the air and slam the ground. Very simple this one. Dodge roll/run backwards and avoid it, then get back IN to position asap, it is VERY important that you get close again once it is gone...\n\n|cffff00Leap|r - The boss will LEAP to the person FURTHEST away in this fight, so STAY CLOSE! If you are too far away it will jump for MILES and you have to spend more resources running around this massive room to reapply damage. The trick is to stay as close as possible the whole fight. That way when it selects a player you will already be so close that the damage already applied will be continued. The boss will move a couple of feet rather than a couple of miles! STAY CLOSE. The leap hits with a large aoe splash just like the jump and should be avoided in the same way.\n\nRemember, follow mechanics, get out, then get back in again!\n\n"

The boss needs to be faced away from the group by the tank at all times, while the healer and the dps stay behind him.\n\n|cffff00Undead Minions|r - Throughout the fight the boss will spawn adds, you must get rid of these fast. The tank should taunt/chain them in while the dps kill them with aoe damage if possible. EVERYONE must stay in the circle with the boss, do not run around the room it will be a mess!\n\n|cffff00Grinning Blot|r - High damage single target bolt which is usually aimed at the person with agro. The tank must NOT drop taunt as this can wipe a squishy!\n\n|cffff00Runes|r - The boss will cast runes on the ground. If you are caught by these you will take HIGH damage and be snared/immobilized. Do not stand in them. Don't run away like a baby, simple move to one side and avoid them. Remember running like a headless chicken puts pressure on the group. Relax!\n\n|cffff00Stay in - Get Out!!|r\n\n|cffff00Lethal Spirit (get out!)|r - This is extremely obvious...The boss will cast an ability where the ground will glow bright pink and souls will rush from the floor. This is a very simple mechanic, GET OUT! Do NOT stand in it. Let it pass then get back in again!\n\n|cffff00Lethal Telekinesis (stay in!)|r - This is the opposite of the above, the boss will put a protective dome over him and the group and the outside of the circle rather than the middle will smash to pieces with some crazy shapes and patterns around the room which will destroy the group...simple mechanic...STAY IN!\n\nThe above two mechanics are random, but they are easy to follow if you understand them...pink floor get out, protective dome, stay in!\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

The tank needs to maintain a taunt at ALL times. The boss and keep it turned away from the group for the entire fight!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The boss stand up on his back legs and launch a HUGE hitting cone aoe heavy attack in the direction of whoever has agro. This should always be the tank. The tank must BLOCK this. If not he/she is dead in one shot, it hits incredibly hard!\n\nIf for any strange reason the boss aims at a dps or a healer during this heavy attack they must apply a well timed dodge roll or they will be killed, a dps/healer CANNOT block this hit, it is way too strong designed for tanks to mitigate.\n\n|cffff00Minions|r - During the fight waves of adds will spawn and must be dealt with. The tank can root the enemies and taunt them in order to control them BUT at the same time must maintain a taunt on the boss and not spin the boss on the group. These adds will spawn at set percentages of the boss's health (75% 50% and 25%) so over burning the boss damage wise, will result in overlapping of the adds and you can get overwhelmed with multiple spawns. These also do heavy attack so the group must be careful if they get focused (these can be blocked).\n\nIf you get overwhelmed with adds do NOT start running away! This will NOT help, let the tank try to control them. Running away will NOT make you loose agro on anything that is chasing you and they WILL chase you until they die. Don't PANIC!\n\nThis is quite easy to work with. Simply get inside the shield and stack and burn the boss.\n\n"

The tank should keep the boss agroed and faced at him/her as much as possible while taunts are able to land (she becomes immune to it during the fight). This is fairly mobile to some extent so people must not panic and must not start running away like a headless chicken. The trick to this fight is add control and focus!\n\n|cffff00Forrest|r - During the fight the boss will become Immune and put up a force field of trees around her. As soon as you see her casting to make this force field go up you must leave the area immediately in order to avoid the knock back and knock down mechanic you will receive for touching the shield. Get OUT! asap! When she is shielded she is immune to all damage and taunts and will select players to hit (more explained below). Once the phase is over, she will teleport to a new location and you can attack her again. This mechanic is rinse repeated throughout the whole fight.\nNOTE: This phase happens at 75% 50% and 30%.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - During the shield phase adds will spawn and the tank must grab them as fast as possible and turn them away from the group! This is when you need as dps to focus the adds not the boss (boss is immune to all damage and taunts) The bear add, above all, must be focused. If this thing hits a dps/healer with it's heavy attack they will die to a one shot even if they block. The tank must block the attack and others must stay out of it. The bear is almost the same as the previous boss just much less health. Once the adds are down go back to the boss and/or wait for her to leave here shield of trees and teleport to a new location.\n\n|cffff00Winters Grasp|r - During the shield phase while you are dealing with the adds, the taunt WILL drop off of the boss. This is when she chooses a player at random (usually a dps) to fire nasty fast moving aoes across the ground. This cold based aoe deals MASSIVE damage and an immobilize. The immobilize part is only really relevant if hitting a tank since a tank would survive it. DPS and/or healers will die to pretty much a one shot. During this agro phase on her chosen target she will also fire light attacks at the same target. This player must have heals focused on them and also move OUT of the aoe when it is aimed at them. Try to find a spot where no one else is standing and just simply watch your feet. Standing near others runs the risk of multiple players getting caught by it and inevitably causing a wipe.\n\n|cffff00Blast|r - The boss will cast a MASSIVE thin cone aoe in the direction of whoever has agro during the fight. The is a blast of rocks/nirncrux type damage and will hit fairly hard and knockback/down anyone caught in it. A tank can block it but others must dodge roll it to get out.\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - During the shield phases, while killing the adds, stranglers will spawn and these MUST be dealt with fast else you will end up filling the room with poison and your group will take HUGE damage (explained prior to the boss IN the video).\n\n"

The tank needs to keep a taunt on the boss at all times. The group need to be very aware of their feet in this fight as there is a lot of awkward ground aoe type damage to deal with.\n\n|cffff00Fire circle|r - During the fight each time the boss teleports to a new location, it will cast 3 light attacks at whoever has agro (should be the tank) each light attack will place a circle of fire on the ground and should be avoided! It won't necessarily one shot you if you stand in it for a brief moment but the damage is very high if you stand in it for more than a second, so try NOT to stand in these. They will disappear after a short time.\n\n|cffff00Atronachs|r - After each full rotation of mechanics the boss raise his hand in the air and lots of red flying projectiles will go from his staff to a random Stone Atronach in the room. THEN he will teleport to a random location. These Atronachs MUST be focused down as soon as possible. If you do not kill them fast enough they will enrage and put nasty circles of nirncrux underneath each player every second over and over doing HIGH damage to anyone caught in them until it is dead. If you keep moving these can be placed on the ground and/or kited (like the Domihaus mechanics) but of course eventually they will catch you and kill you. So it is crucial that the Atronach dies in order to defeat this mechanic from wiping your group.\n\n|cffff00Space Invaders!!|r - The best way i can describe this mechanic is 'space invaders!'. Basically the boss will squat and LOADS of very small fast moving aoes will fly around the floor aiming at the group members over and over until he has finished channeling this effect. Basically this is where old school space invader training comes in and you basically just have to wiggle between them and avoid being hit. Simple left right left right movements to avoid them will be just fine. DO NOT sprint around the room because of course you will overlap to many of them and kill people. Relax, wiggle a bit, and then carry on. If these hit you they can take as much as 30-40% health per hit, so be careful!\n\n|cffff00Root|r - While the boss is under 25% health he will start rooting the players in vines so their feet are stuck to the ground. If you stay inside this mechanic for the full duration, once it has finished it will burst and you will take HIGH damage. The way to defeat this mechanic is simply to dodge roll to break out of it when you see the effect. So for magicka users above all, do NOT sprint around the room too much, you will need your resources to avoid this mechanic.\n\n"

Small fighting area and LOTS of major already taught mechanics, in ONE fight! The tank must NOT drop taunt on this boss under any circumstances if they can help it. Sure the tank should never drop the boss anyway, that is bad practice...but this one will issue wipes SO fast!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack eruption!|r - The boss will fire off a heavy attack with a massive swing of his weapon EXACTLY the same as the mechanics from the other Minotaurs in the dungeon, where once the heavy has landed, a tiny aoe will be placed in the floor in the position in which hi hit and a volcano eruption type mechanic will rapidly spew from it's position. The tank MUST stand on this and plug the hole while holding block!\n\n|cffff00Swing|r - The boss (normally after his heavy attack) will swing in frontal aoe at the person with agro and 3 small fire aoes will emit from this attack. Simply step out of these, they are the same sice as the space invader aoes and do about the same damage.\n\n|cffff00Shalks|r - If you have got this far you SHOULD by now have understood this mechanic, but i will explain it anyway. Throughout the fight Shalks will spawn and they need to be focused. These Shalks will target an individual with a negative aoe chasing them around until it catches them and then on impact will explode and hit them with a terribly aggressive fire damage over time (note most people will never live through this even with big heals). If YOU are the Shalk's target, you will get a message on your screen and your screen will have flames around the edges. This is when you must RUN away and jump onto one of the platforms in the lava. Once the aoe following your dissolves in the lava you can jump off and come back into the fight. You MUST get rid of this effect, do not try to tank it, you will die. You should have up to 5 of these from start to finish in the fight. Depending on how fast you kill the boss.\n\n|cffff00Atronachs|r - Once the boss hits 50% he will wake up the Stone Atronachs in the room, one per phase. These are identical to the ones in the previous boss fight (explained above) and must be killed as soon as possible. Failure to do so will cause them to cast aoes under the feet of each player and you will have to constantly move to avoid them while also placing them on the floor making it very difficult to stand anywhere without dying. These Atronachs MUST be killed asap at all costs.\n\n|cffff00BIG BOOM!|r - The boss will pound his weapon into the ground and an ENORMOUS aoe will spread rapidly around the entire platform! This is when every single member must run away and jump onto one of the platforms/rocks surrounding the area. Once the aoe explodes and all the fire is gone you can jump off and come back into the room again, however some things to note.\nWhen the aoe is gone but the fire is still present do NOT jump in, the fire will one shot you.\nAlso the pads/rocks/platforms...they can only take a certain amount of timed pressure (player standing on them) per pad. SO if one person uses it of course over time it will pop and disappear, BUT if multiple players stand on them, it applies more pressure and they will disappear SOONER! One pad per person or else #RIP!\n\nIf you do not get to a pad you will die, if you jump back in too soon (fire still present) you will die, and if you get greedy and use more than one person to a pad, you will of course inevitably die in the lava. Focus and co-ordinate!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 GHERIG BULLBLOOD |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is actually 3 bosses and they MUST be controlled. The tank should keep a taunt on these at all times! The bull will stand where e wants and is quite stubborn so it is safer to taunt him in the face and hold him still. The melee boss will come to the tank if taunted since he is melee and therefore can also be easily stacked on the bull but the healer/ranged boss won't come to you unless you are out of her range with agro (tank taunting 101, basically get out of their range and they will move to you until they can reach). With this in mind, grab both Bull and melee add with taunts and taunt the ranged too. Run backwards to bring the ranged boss in a bit and then run back to HER with the two melee dps for a nice easy stack. This is demonstrated in the video.\n\n|cffff00Chains|r - The Minotaur has the same mechanics as some of the ones you have encountered in the dungeon so far but it is crucial that you pay attention. The boss will pin 2 members of the group with chains and then a spreading aoe will appear under their feet. The boss MUST be interrupted to break the chains and the people pinned (now set free) MUST move out of the aoe. The chains maybe released but the aoe will still explode. failure to interrupt or get out of danger once the interrupt is initiated will result in a borderline one shot!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The Minotaur and the melee boss can both heavy attack. These must be blocked by the tank else he/she will be knocked back/down and quite possibly killed!\n\n|cffff00Burst!|r - The Melee boss will cast a MASSIVE spreading aoe on the group centered from himself. This must be avoided. If you don't get out of range of it before it bursts you will take HUGE damage and be stunned if it didn't already kill you. Which means you would have to break free. Overlapping these mechanics all above and failure to interrupt one target while this stun aoe hits is a catastrophe, focus!\n\n|cffff00Heal|r - The ranged Boss (mage) can heal the other two and herself. This should be interrupted as soon as it is spotted.\n\n|cffff00Elemental attacks|r - The mage has many short duration channel abilities which cause damage to the group in the form of both direct and aoe damage depending on which one she is performing at the time. These can be interrupted. She is probably the easiest boss of the 3 if controlled but she MUST be interrupted. So long as you interrupt her every time you see her casting...Healing and damage dealing for her is almost impossible. So a very simple boss if you are paying attention.\n\nAbove all, these 3 need to be killed as fast as possible and stacking is your safest bet. Stack all 3 together, don't drop taunts and interrupt the mechanics at ALL costs. Focus down the bull first to get rid of the chain mechanic, get rid of the melee boss afterwards since you only then have to deal with heavy attacks and the aoe, and then finally kill the mage. DO NOT sit near the middle of the room as lava pools will spread from the center and kill you (they stun/cc if you are hit with 3 rock hits in a row from the nirncrux/lava).\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 EARTHGORE AMALGAM |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is a LOT simpler than it looks but due to all of the dramatic effects it can get somewhat chaotic. The tank must NOT drop taunt at ALL costs. You have ONE boss, but will end up with 3 targets. You tank MUST be capable of managing resources, and keeping agro on up to 3 targets at all times! Basically if you can tank the axes (up to 3) in Aetherian Archive, you are pretty much capable. If not, get more practice. You have ZERO room for error here. Positioning, co-ordination are key for the group but above all the tank MUST pay attention.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack!|r - his is a simple as it gets. The boss will fire off a HUGE heavy attack. If the tank is blocking, they will survive, if not they are dead. If this hits a dps/healer player while blocking, they will die anyway. It is a very hard hit, you need the mitigation a tank can bring. So if something goes horribly wrong and the tank ends up dropping the boss, and you as a dps or healer have agro, your only chance is to dodge roll...do NOT run away or start legging it around the room, he will still catch you, you will still die, and someone will have to pick you up because you made a mess of it. Simply DODGE at the right time so the tank can recover.\n\n|cffff00Lava/nirncrux pool!|r - THIS is possibly the most important mechanic in the fight. The boss will channel with his hand into the ground in the direction of HIS CHOICE and a fire/nirncrux trail will shoot across the floor and emit a pool of lava/nirncrux. This can be close, it could be far but whatever happens do NOT touch it and do NOT stay close to it! If you stay close to it you will take damage every second from projectiles spewing from it. 3 hits in a row will fossilize you and you i will be stunned while still taking damage and die! Most people will die before that even happens so simply stay the hell away from this stuff!\nThis can land ANYWHERE so keep your wits about you. Sometimes you can get lucky and it can fire all around the outside of the room, other times it can be close by. The tank needs to be the one to control the boss during this mechanic. If the lava is a long way away, keep tanking the boss where he is. If not and it is too close to you, then be sure to reposition the boss and move together as a group.\n\n|cffff00Rocks|r - During the fight rocks will fall from the ceiling, be sure to step out of these or they will issue HIGH damage if you are not a tank.\n\n|cffff00Rain!|r - The boss will go Immune during the fight at stages and when he is immune he will cause rocks to rain from the sky. Each player will have rocks aimed directly at them and must move out of the aoes before they land. This is fairly easy to avoid but try to find your own space and not run around like a headless chicken not considering your team mates. If you do this you will end up stacking them and killing your friends. DON'T PANIC! Once the phase is over carry on as normal.\n\n|cffff00The Split!|r - This is where things get tricky. The boss has two very simple mechanics...The lava pool and the heavy attack, and these will happen at a steady pace through out the fight. Rinse repeat right? Well yes and no. This is something that is easily manageable on it's own but of course the famous Mike Finnigan would not make it THAT simple would he?...no.\n\nAt 80% the boss will split into two, so a large one and a smaller one. They now both have their own Health bars but they SHARE the overall boss health percentage. This NEW boss can do exactly the same as the last one. So yes, NOW you have 2x heavy attacks to deal with as the tank and a potential 2x lava pool placements! The room is now getting a little, claustrophobic with all the lava filling the room! You should now try to focus the new boss while still damaging the main one!\n\nAt 50% OVERALL! a third boss will appear! a much smaller one with less health and yes now the health bar is split across all 3x bosses...And you guess it, you now have 3x heavy attacks to deal with as the tank and 3x lava pool casts because each boss is an exact duplicate of the other!\n\nNOW here comes the tactic. The longer the bosses are alive the more often they will cast aoes and the more often they will heavy attack..SO you want to close the gap as much as possible and get those additional bosses down as soon as you can so that you don't have to deal with so many stacking mechanics.\n\nSO, SAVE your ultimates. Do not start with a nuke. Use your ultimates when the SECOND boss appears in order to push the 80-50% gap faster. This means that you have 2 bosses on their own for less time so that they do not both together have too much opportunity to overlap heavy attacks and lava pools (the longer they are together the longer the fight and the more the room gets filled).\n\nPushing for the 3rd boss to appear in the room lessens the time you have to deal with so much going on. This does FORCE all 3 to appear and FORCE you to have now 3 over lapping mechanics, but if done fast enough and efficiently enough you will not have had enough time to yet fill the room with lava, meaning you can now afford the additional casts from the bosses to do their thing since you have more space than taking your time.\n\nKill the small boss first (he will be almost in execute range as he comes out, he has very little health. Meaning the 3rd overlap is now gone, then focus the middle one and then finally the last man standing should be the first boss you started with.\n\nIf you push 2 and 3 to appear fast and then push them to die fast, you can take as long as you like on the last one because only ONE lava mechanic is left.\n\nDamage output can of course play a contributing role in this fight to make things easier, BUT tactical damage application (regardless of dps amount in the group) in the way of strategically selecting your targets for the right timing and placing of your ultimates is what makes the fight much smoother.\n\nNOTE: The 'Rain' Mechanic will still take place regardless of how many bosses are alive BUT it will randomly happen from ONE of them, not all 3.\n\nLearn the mechanics and above all understand them, best of luck!!"

Already you have been taught the mechanics about the lights(as also explained in the video) but this is where they really count. The tank needs to keep the boss and the adds with him/her at all times and keep her IN the light. You have every right to be scared of the dark here! If you try to attack her in the dark she will only receive 10% of all damage, so she must always be in the circle.\n\n|cffff00Power up|r - The boss will try channel an ability between her random poison spits which will make her stronger. This is extremely easy to spot and can be interrupted. So long as you interrupt every time, this mechanic will never actually happen!\n\n|cffff00Spiders|r - The spiders are the same as the ones you encountered in the tunnel. The same rules apply. Keep them together, kill them with as much aoe as possible and keep them IN THE LIGHT!\n\n|cffff00Braziers|r - Throughout the fight the braziers will go out! Be sure to move to the middle one at 50% and turn it on taking the boss with you. Then light the final one and take the boss to it at 30%. It helps if you can have one member keep an eye on the health of the boss and make an early run for the brazier to get a bit of a head start so that people are not in the dark so long.\n\n|cffff00Poison spits|r - The boss will spit poison randomly during the fight at the person with agro (should be the tank) simply block these when they hit you, their damage is not anything too difficult to manage.\n\n"

If ONE person doesn't understand the mechanics with this and/or at least co-ordinate with the group it becomes a complete mess. The tank needs to taunt at ALL times and keep the boss in the light!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will hit with a DEVASTATING heavy attack. The tank should be the only one getting hit by this and you MUST block! If a dps or healer gets hit with this, block and pray...you MAY survive. Key point to remember however is NOT to run away, she will kill you if you are not blocking regardless.\n\n|cffff00Burst|r - The boss will create a large spreading aoe and when it reaches full size it will explode. You as dps and healers must stay OUT of this. If it touches you, you are dead. Tanks can block it but i would not recommend it, simply step out of it and get back in again when it is gone.\n\n|cffff00Spiders|r - The spiders you have seen 100 times before already, keep them in the lights, control them and kill them. Do NOT run away or run around in circles, this will make things really difficult for the tank. The fight must be controlled.\n\n|cffff00Teleport|r - After every Burst aoe she does (once per phase) she will teleport to a random brazier in the room and turn it off. During this phase shadows will appear and start shooting at the group. Get your team to turn the braziers back on asap else you will eventually run the risk of running out of lights. The shadows don't last long but the light will get rid of them.\n\n|cffff00Shadow bolts|r - Every time she teleports she will also cast an attack which will cast 4 shadow bolts at the ground, one at each player. This deals HUGE damage and knocks down. For some players this can be a guaranteed one shot. To prevent this, when she teleports you MUST keep your eyes open and look for the channeling of this ability and interrupt it asap! Long ranged interrupts like 'crushing shock' help like hell in this fight!\n\n"

The tank should hold this boss in the MIDDLE of the room, NOT the corner. The middle is safe, the corner is dead. Remember that!\n\n|cffff00Spider adds|r - During the fight very small spider adds will enter the room from the ceiling. These should die very fast to passive aoe damage on the ground if you have any but need to die fast else they can cause a problem with small negative aoes and projectiles hitting the group.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - Very simple here, a heavy attack should be something you are very familiar with by now, BLOCK when it is about to hit you. This should only be aimed at the tank unless a taunt has fallen off. If this aims at a dps or healer role be sure again to BLOCK, do NOT run, you will die!\n\n|cffff00Poison Circles|r - During the fight the boss will place multiple poison circles on the ground which cause HUGE damage to anyone standing in them...Don't stand in them, that could not be any clearer!\n\n|cffff00Feeding|r - If the boss channels and tries to feed off of dead spiders, you MUST interrupt it. The boss can heal more than 10% per second and this fight will be a really long one if not paid attention too.\n\n|cffff00BOOM!|r - The boss will make a MASSIVE spreading aoe which explodes when it reaches full size. This must be avoided at all costs! As soon as you see these, get OUT of it! Even some of the strongest tanks out there will receive a one shot from this, even if they are blocking. Once it has gone, get back into position again. THIS is why you use the middle of the room and not the corner. If you are in the corner, you have NO WHERE to go! Boom...dead.\n\n"

The boss has several phases and there is a lot of aoe in the room so you must watch your feet and not run around like a headless chicken. The tank should hold the boss still as much as possible and NEVER drop taunt. If you drop taunt the mechanics will apply to other members of the group rather than the tank and wipes will happen over and over.\n\n|cffff00Shadows|r - The boss will go immune to all damage (but can still be taunted for agro). During this phase the statue in the middle will emit nasty red waves of damage across the floor (you must avoid these) and 3 shadows will be placed around the room. Now you need to kill these as fast as possible and then pick up the red orbs that they drop. Once 3 orbs have been picked up the boss is able to be attacked again and will be stunned for a brief moment giving you a dps window. An easy way to deal with this is (as explained in the video) to get your tank to pull IN the shadows to the middle and kill them there. It saves people running around the room and is much more controlled.\n\n|cffff00Mortar|r - The boss raise his hand in the air occasionally and a red blot will leave his hand and land on the floor with a large round aoe. Once it hits the floor it will split and do additional damage in different directions as it disappears. Be sure to ALWAYS stay out of this. When it is coming your way, move!\n\n|cffff00Tick Tick SPIN!|r - The boss will spawn 2 adds with very low health and they are pinning whoever has agro to the ground, there is NOTHING the person pinned can do. This is why you must not ever let the tank taunt fall off, because if you do, one of the dps/healers will be pinned instead. During the pinned phase (which lasts about 2-3 seconds (it is very fast) the boss will wind up a HUGE heavy attack. If your group doesnt interrupt the TWO adds, the heavy attack will hit the target and kill them outright, guaranteed one shot!\n\nIf your group are successful and they manage to release the target, the player MUST BLOCK! The heavy attack is still coming and you must defend yourself. All other players should stand back once the boss is loose because this heavy attack is not just on the target but in aoe too, it is an extremely aggressive steel tornado!\n\nSO, group interrupt, tank block asap!\n\n\n\n|cffff00Teleport strike|r - This is exactly the same as the last boss in Spindleclutch II in terms of mechanics, but with a slight twist. The boss will teleport strike from one group member to the next until all 4 have been hit, then he will go back to his original spot. The way to mitigate this is to simply BLOCK. Each player blocks and then he will move to the next! However the slight twist is that once he has connected with each player he will leave an aoe under people (so 4x aoes eventually) be sure once you have blocked, to step out of this and not take any additional damage.\n\n"

LOTS of mechanics, lots of unforgiving situations and random twists making the difference between a pass and a fail. The tank needs to keep hold of this boss at all times and if possible hold her to one side of the room. NOT in the middle if you can help it, there is a LOT going on.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will fire off a simple heavy attack during the fight. It isn't particularly powerful but should be blocked by whoever she is targeting.\n\n|cffff00Flurry|r - The boss cast a very small frontal cone aoe in the form of a flurry, simply block this and all will be fine but because of this the tank should NOT spin the boss on the group. A dps or healer can die fast to this.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - During the fight melee and ranged adds will spawn. These must be focused! The ranged need interrupting when they channel abilities and the melee must be watched carefully else they will uppercut you. If the tank can grab these and hold them on the boss without spinning her around this makes things a lot easier. The most important mechanics are based on the boss's health so don't over burn her. Kill the adds first and then move on to her!\n\n|cffff00Don't Move A Muscle!|r - If she starts to climb into the ceiling, she will shout 'don't move a muscle'...do NOT MOVE! no matter what happens, do NOT move!( note: also a message will pop up saying 'Velidreth prepares to hunt from the shadows')...once the room starts to go light again she will jump down to the floor again. Look up at the celing, as soon as you see her wiggle, dodge roll immediately!\n\nIf you dodge roll or move early, you are dead! Big spike up the whoo-harr!And if dodge roll too late? same applies. This is a one shot mechanic! It is EXTREMELY rare for anyone to live through this.\n\n|cffff00Devour|r - Do not save your ultimates for Christmas to come around again! Velidreth will look for the person saving up ultimate and draw them in. She will devour your ultimate pool rendering whatever ultimate you thought you were holding on to, USELESS. So the tip for this is, use your ultimates as soon as they are ready and/or use the cheapest ultimates you possibly can.\n\n|cffff00Draining orbs|r - There are orbs flying around the room which sometimes change colour, this is especially dangerous while under 30% health because the room is full of red ones. Basically each ball will drain the resources relevant to the colour they are if you touch them. Green will drain your stamina, blue will drain you magicka, and red will of course drain your health. Avoid these at all costs!\n\n|cffff00Atronachs|r - These are KEY for the catacombs. When the atronachs spawn 81% and around 51% you MUST focus them. Don't push the boss, kill them fast. Each one will drop a light on the floor. Asign two members of your group to pick on up each. You will be split into two groups at random and one person of each group will be holding the light. If you don't pick these up you are very unlikely to complete the next phase.\n\n|cffff00Banished to the catacombs|r - The boss will banish the group to the catacombs (maze) and this will happen TWICE in the fight. Once at 66% and again at 31%. Both groups of two will be sent off, each with 1 light (previously picked up by the atronach deaths.\n\nWhat you need to do here is stay together and find your way through the map back to the middle. Find the open door ways and make your way to safety.\n\nNow there are some mechanics to consider. The light is to save you from the dark so do not run away from your team mate and leave them in the dark else they will be snared and eventually die to aoe. There are dremora adds and hoavors in the catacombs trying to beat you down. Don't try to focus these down because you WILL just get overwhelmed by them. Keep down snares/roots etc to cc them while they are chasing you (note, time stop is very good for this). Each connecting path between each room has traps on the floor but the light will reveal them, so watch your feet and don't stand on the red pads.\n\nWhich door is open? That is for YOU to find out. On regular mode it is quite easy to find your way out, but on Hardmode mode doors are CLOSED! So you have to back track a lot if luck is not on your side.\n Which of course means running through the adds you already left behind. Too much of this will end up with you getting focused down by an army of enemies.\n\nA very helpful tip for these doors is that the door you used the FIRST time you were banished will still be open the SECOND time...how good is your memory ? ;)\n\nOnce you get back into the middle the fight continues as normal but if you are coming back into the boss room for the second time from the catacombs (31% health) no more additional mechanics are added. Watch the orbs, stay out of her face if you are a dps/healer, hold her still as a tank and control any adds. Stack and burn from here, it is execute, so focus and do not die!\n\n|cffff00Resurrection tips!|r - IF someone tries to resurrect, the boss will cast a fast paced projectile to interrupt the resser. If you spot her doing this, interrupt her so she cannot stop the res and she will not duplicate this action for at least 10 seconds. SO if you are a really meaty tank and you are trying to save your group (last man standing) START a res then cancel it and interrupt the boss...THEN go back to the res and she wont try it giving you a window for recovery. #dummyres!\n\nThe fight is rough and i will take patience, co-ordination, practice, and as far as the doors in the catacombs are concerned, a bit of rng!\n\nBest of luck!\n\n"

This will take some co-ordination and above all as LITTLE panic as possible. Sounds easy right? Well actually to most based on this boss's design that is the complete opposite of what ends up happening in PUGS. This boss to the inexperienced player can come across terrifying, so if you don't like horror films, leave that at the door! The tank will need to focus, be very careful of positioning, do NOT drop taunt, and above all collectively, stay together as a group during the mechanics. Scooby Doo is usually right, splitting up to look for the bad guys is a BAD idea (you will see why)!\n\n|cffff00Breath|r - As expected of Hunger type enemies, this boss does have a  nasty frontal cone shaped breath attack. This does high damage over time and needs to be avoided. If you are dps or healers and you stand in this you WILL die. The tank must try to keep the boss faced away from the group and block this while staying alive. If you run around the breath will follow you and you will end up spinning this onto the group and they will wipe. You MUST maintain a taunt and keep it off the group. If the boss goes loose for any reason and you as a dps/healer are in it, the best option you have for survival is to dodge roll through the boss to spin it BACK onto the tank so they can recover. But generally if this mechanic is not controlled, you are dead.\n\n|cffff00Spit|r - The boss fire a nasty poison spit at the tank (or whoever has agro). When this lands, anyone standing in it will take HUGE damage over time. Most tanks will not be able to stand up to this.\nNot to mention the boss will actually fire this twice! So when it lands, step backwards out of it with the boss (maintaining a taunt) and when the second one lands do the same (walk backwards). Once you are out of BOTH of the aoes you will be safe. The dps and healers should follow the tank's path BUT do NOT stand in stupid, you will die!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will Launch a heavy attack and if this is on the tank a simple block will suffice. If you miss you are going to be knocked down and most likely will die.\n\n|cffff00Shadow Jump|r - The boss will vanish into the air and a heavy attack mechanic (white sparks) will be aimed at the group, presented by a spreading aoe under the feet of the players. When the aoe hits is peak and he is about to HIT, dodge roll out of it and your sill survive. If you don't you will be killed!\n\n|cffff00Hide and seek!|r - This is the mechanic that makes everyone panic. You are in a scary warehouse type room with an invisible hunger stalking you!\nThis will happen based on health and at each stage you will have to complete this phase the same way.\nThis will happen at 80%, 50% and finally at 25%!\n\nThe boss will disappear and you will need to find him, BUT aoes will spawn out of the ground, which you MUST avoid (represented by a spreading aoe and then a totem will appear). Adds will spawn (as many as 3 hungers) which need to be killed and if you FIND the boss...whoever found him will be fed on and pinned to the ground.\n\nTHIS is the most important thing to note...make your TANK lead the group and everyone must STAY TOGETHER! If you split up the one left alone and they accidentally trigger the boss they will be fed on and die in the dark!\n\nWhen someone finds the boss you must interrupt the boss to get them off of your team mate and then continue the fight with the above mechanics.\n\nKey points: Stay together, kill adds, avoid aoes, interrupt the boss when he jumps out and pins whoever finds him. If you stick to this, you will be fine. If not it is your own horror story!\n\n"

If you try to NUKE this boss and you don't have good aoe damage, you will get overwhelmed with adds and these adds are NO picnic. These can heavy attack a dps and one shot them, they can even one shot a tank! SO, pay attention to the mechanics, watch your feet and try not to show off too much. Most pugs wipe and rage quit because of these problems.\n\n|cffff00Geyser|r - This is a typical Nerid/leminid type mechanic which if you have seen Scaelcaller you should be familiar with. Multiple geysers will spray out of the ground. If you get hit by these you will be suspended in the air and take HUGE damage. Watch your feet and don't stand in these!\n\n|cffff00ICE!!!|r - This is extremely easy to see. You will get 2 types of AOE attacks in the room which look like big whirling ice effects. These must be avoided following the description of each type below and at low health you will get BOTH!Outside AOE: This is a big ring around the outside of the room which you need to avoid by staying in the middle of the room.\nInside AOE: This is the same as the above but instead of being on the outside of the room, is in the middle! Simply do the opposite of the above and stay on the outside.\nExecute AOE: During low health you will get BOTH of these aoes and there will be a thin strip between the two which you must stand in to avoid them both.\n\n|cffff00Ice Atronach|r - These adds must be focused. They have huge heavy attacks and put nasty stunning and immobilizing high damage based aoes on the ground. When these are up stop focusing the boss and kill them as soon as possible.\n\n|cffff00Small Ice Aoes|r - These are pretty much the same as the aoes the Atronachs can place just a bit larger, watch your feet. These usually happen before the Geysers spawn.\n\n|cffff00Watchers!|r - These adds MUST die as a priority target at ALL costs and the tank must have these taunted at ALL times. They have high health, they have nasty aoe attacks and above all their heavy attack can one shot even the meatiest tank if they are not blocking. DPS and healers CANNOT block their heavy attack. If one of these is swinging at you, be sure to time it well and dodge roll other wise it is goodnight!\n\nThese will spawn at health % of the boss and this is why you have to be careful not to over burn unless you can really handle it!\n\nThey spawn at 75%, 55% and 35% health."

There are a lot of things going on here. 4 mechanics that have to be understood as well as a main target and SO many adds! Your tank has to be not only strong, but capable of holding agro on MULTIPLE targets and keeping them OFF the group. If adds start running around the room, everyone is dead! The main focus is of course the Dark Orb, but during the fight at health % the dark orb will introduce new mechanics which together you must focus before killing the main target. So, team work is KEY here.\n\n|cffff00Basic adds|r - During the fight several different basic adds will spawn, melee types, archer types and mages and these are fairly low health. The tank should pull these together as soon as possible and they should be killed by the group. These are not a real threat but on top of the BIG adds that are coming, can get a little overwhelming, so be sure to kill these, and interrupt arrow spray type abilities!\n\n|cffff00Aurorans|r - These adds will spawn through out the fight and there are 4 different types.\nEach one has different effects but all are deadly! The can cast dawn breakers, different elemental effects and also some nasty frontal aoe lightning jedi power type abilities. The tank MUST grab these and keep them faced away from the group at all times.\n\nThe 4 different types are :\nRadiant Auroran (Jesus beam)\nPhosphorescent Auroran (ice)\nBlazing Auroran (fire)\nScintillating Auroran (lightning)\n\nEach one of these can have similar effects to the orbs of their corresponding types.\n\n \n\n|cffff00ORBS!|r - During the fight the Dark orb will spawn OTHER orbs in the room as well as the adds!\n\nThis is when you need to take your focus off the main target and focus the orb in the room. There are 4 types of orbs:\n\n|cffff00Radiant (yellow)|r - These can affect the group with healing debuffs\n\n|cffff00Phosphorescent (blue)|r - These cause aoe ice damage and place ice aoes on the ground which MUST be avoided however they do spawn an ice pillar in the middle of them and they can be killed with JUST a light attack. The healer will need to focus heals to anyone close to these due to the amount of aoe damage they emit.\n\n|cffff00Blazing (red)|r - These call down meteors to each player and when they land they burst into multiple floor based moving aoes. You must avoid the meteor and THEN get in the gaps between the scattered aoes after wards. These are tricky and must be learnt to be dealt with FAST (incredibly important for the last boss).\n\n|cffff00Scintillating (purple)|r - These cause lightning damage and can cast multiple fast paced splashes on the ground coming from EACH player. Moving in a fast tight circle will make you avoid the damage and let them disburse but if you do not, you will get overwhelmed with damage and die fast!\n\nTACTICS!: Focus the Dark orb, when the adds spawn get the tank to pull them all into the corner and focus them with aoe and ultimates.\n\nWhile orbs are present, KILL the orb and THEN kill remaining adds before going back to the main orb in the middle. When the next orb spawns, go kill the orb, THEN the adds, then the dark orb, rinse repeat!\n\n"

This is where a completely new mechanic comes into play. You start off fighting the boss in the middle of the room with the tank turning the boss away and simply focus on what you are doing while interrupting mechanics as and when, BUT things are about to get crazy. The boss will split into x4!! The tank needs to taunt ALL bosses and manipulate their positioning with range to get them as close to each other as possible while MAINTAINING taunts and helping to interrupt them. This is gona get tricky!\n\n|cffff00The Split!|r - The boss splits into x4 reflections each with a damage and only ONE of them is the real one. There are many ways to do this but in the video we demonstrated what i would consider one of the easiest methods (apart from 'cheesing' which we will NOT be doing!).\nEach time the boss splits up, get the 2 dps to focus on ONE target. If the damage shield falls off and that target disappears, if is a fake one and move on to the next. Rinse and repeat.\nHOWEVER, if the damage shield falls off and it continues to take damage...STAY on THAT BOSS! it is the REAL one!\nThe tank at this point needs to keep taunts, and interrupts while trying to carefully position them as close to each other as possible to prevent lots of running around the room.\n\nNOTE: every boss reflection can have the SAME abilities as the main boss. There are a LOT of interrupts to pay attention to! Sometimes 2x per boss in less than 5 seconds. This is where your most BASIC 'tutorial taught mechanics' come into play. Pace your resources and be sure to utilize the 'bash' move, or abilities that physically interrupt targets as MUCH as possible. If you do not, you WILL wipe.\n\nLazy players here will cause constant wipes. So focus on the mechanics.\n\n\n\n|cffff00Against the elements!|r - The boss and every reflection can have a RANDOM color (blue/red/yellow/purple) and yes unfortunately if you didn't pay attention to the previous fight this will make NO sense.\nSimply put however, each colour represents the ORB abilities from the Previous fight.\n\nYellow - Affects the group with (life steal) healing debuffs and can cast Jesus beam (Radiant Oppression) which can and MUST be interrupted.\n\nBlue - AOE Ice damage as well as a spreading ice blast (don't stand in this) and place ice aoes on the ground which MUST be avoided however they do spawn an ice pillar in the middle of them and they can be killed with JUST a light attack.\n\nRed - These call down meteors to each player and when they land they burst into multiple floor based moving aoes. You must avoid the meteor and THEN get in the gaps between the scattered aoes.\n\nPurple - These cause lightning damage splashes and can cast multiple fast paced splashes on the ground coming from EACH player. Moving in a fast tight circle will make you avoid the damage and let them disburse but if you do not, you will get overwhelmed with damage and die fast!\n\n|cffff00Power Of The Light|r - This is pretty much the same as the Templar ability. This will be cast onto one player and over time it will absorb more damage before it explodes. Be sure to interrupt if you see the boss or any reflections channeling.\n\n|cffff00Dawn Breaker!|r - The boss/reflections will occasionally cast a dawn breaker sword slamming animation and will do HUGE damage to people in front of it. Do not stand infront of the bosses when this happens and if you are the tank, be sure to block.\n\n|cffff00Tharayya and Quintus!|r - During the fight Quintus and Tharayya are fighting! Keep heals on Tharayya (we did in the video with basic aoe heals on the ground) to stop her from getting into trouble. If the Ghost gets the better of her, the bosses will get MASSIVE damage shields and the fight will get a LOT tougher. Be careful! The healer has a lot to do here keeping the group up and the NPC, BUT many hots and many aoe ground based aoe heals is key to everyone's survival!\n\n"

However above all this fight is 100% built on co-ordination and footwork. There is NO rush and there is NO dps requirement. This fight really is ALL about mechanics!\nThe tank should hold the boss in the center of the room and the gorup should stand in a triangle formation BEHIND the boss. Never drop the taunt on that boss!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is a very simple and obvious mechanic, the boss will hit with a large wound up heavy attack and this MUST be blocked. If for some reason you are not the tank and the heavy attack is coming to you, time it well and DODGE roll it. Do not run away do NOT try to block, you WILL die.\n\n|cffff00Aoe and Stun|r - This is a very simple mechanic. One player in the group will be picked at random and a spreading aoe will spawn under their feet and be connected to them. Do NOT panic, do NOT run, this is on YOU. So simply block while it pops and when it does, break from from it.  Stay as still as possible and do not put it on top of your team mates. If someone else has this on them do NOT run into the aoe. Let it run it's course.\n\n|cffff00SPIN!|r - This is very very similar to the first boss in Hel Ra, where the boss spins his swords like crazy and has an AOE showing the distance in which the spin will reach. Prior to this you get a brief warning of the aoe spreading. Once it hits its peak it will start. Anyone caught in this spin will die unless they are a tank. Some tanks can stand still and block it, others may want to walk back wards holding block to slowly kite the boss until it is over. BUT at all costs you must NOT run through the group with this. DPS and Healers should just stay out of the spin.\n\n|cffff00Sword Throwing|r - The boss will channel an ability where he will look like he is hugging himself. This can be interrupted but if NOT he will throw his swords spinning out in front of him and then they will return again. This deals moderate damage and is not too much of a threat to the tank but should be avoided by the dps and healers. If your tank is experienced in the first boss of Hel Ra, so far all of these mechanics are going to be extremely familiar and borderline identical.\n\n|cffff00THE WALL!!!|r - Do NOT panic! Yes you have seen the ghost wall in fang lair and this is no different in the way that it works damage wise...Basically if you touch it, you die. BUT unlike fang lair you can KILL the ghosts! Wach phase there will be two walls. One in front and one behind. Simply get your group to focus on ONE ghost and kill it, then get in the new gap to be safe and let the wall pass. The easiest option most of the time is to agree on the middle target. That way the tank really doesn't ever have to move and you can continue as normal.\n\n|cffff00Aurorans!|r - During Health % stages of the boss, as well as the wall phase, the boss will go IMMUNE!\nWhen this happens there will be 4x sow walking Aurorans coming from each corner of the room. Red, purple, yellow, blue and each one represents the damage types and effects from previous bosses.\nYou need to kill the Aurorans of YOUR choice before they reach the middle. Each one that REACHES the boss will dissolve and buff him with THAT effect for 40seconds!!!\n\nIf he consumes a yellow add he will be able to apply a heal debuff to the group and a Jesus beam to the tank\nIf he consumes red he will apply meteors\nIf he consumes blue he will spawn ice aoes and pillars and aoe ice damage\nIf he consumes Purple he will spawn nasty lightning splashes.\n\nAll of these were explained in detail in other bosses but you must understand what each one does fully to fight against it.\n\nIt is not the end of the world if he gets buffed because it is time based and if you understand the mechanics you can avoid them, BUT the more of the Aurorans you kill, the less he will be buffed and the easier it will be. However if you can only kill one, we found the red meteor buff to be the most dangerous, so focus the red one. Failing that, the lighting (purple one ) can also be an issue. So prioritize a target and stick to it.\n\nThis stage will happen around 80% and again at around 50-45% (depending on overlapping mechanics).\n\n|cffff00ORBS!|r - During the fight the orbs from the 'Dark Orb' boss will appear in the room with a random colour! This is when you need to take your focus off boss and get the orb down as fast as possible. Orb ALWAYS takes priority!! UNLESS there is a wall coming in which case, wall first, orb second, boss last!\n\nEXACTLY like before there are 4 types of orbs:\n\nYellow - These can affect the group with a healing debuffs\n\nBlue - These cause aoe ice damage and place ice aoes on the ground which MUST be avoided however they do spawn an ice pillar in the middle of them and they can be killed with JUST a light attack. The healer will need to focus heals to anyone close to these due to the amount of aoe damage they emit.\n\nRed - These call down meteors to each player and when they land they burst into multiple floor based moving aoes. You must avoid the meteor and THEN get in the gaps between the scattered aoes after wards. These are tricky and must be learnt to be dealt with FAST.\n\nPurple - These cause lightning damage and can cast multiple fast paced splashes on the ground coming from EACH player. Moving in a fast tight circle will make you avoid the damage and let them disburse but if you do not, you will get overwhelmed with damage and die fast!\n\n|cffff00THE FINAL FIGHT!!!|r - At 11% health and below (depending on overlapping mechanics the boss will go into the Celestial Realm and drag you down with him. His MAX health doubles and his health goes up to 50%...so basically yes, you have over 7million health to get through.\n\nTHIS is a lot simpler than people think. It isnt a burn fest, there is no execute mechanic or panic. You can take as long as you need to BUT there are rules!\n\nThe tank needs to taunt the boss at all times of course and keep the boss faced away from the group.\nWhen you first spawn into the other realm the boss is so busy putting down long ranged attacks that he in fact wont move, so you DO have a bit of a burst moment here if you want to take advantage of it. FAILING that, save up your ultimates for the ORBS! Yes they are coming.\n\nThe boss now has ALL 4 element type attacks!\n\nRadiant = 5 second heal debuff and jesus beam on the tank\nLightning splashes = Tight circles away from people to kite your splashes away from you.\nMeteors = avoid the impact and then avoid the splash from the center of them (basically get away)\nIce = kill the pillar and don't stand in the aoe\n\nThese above all are EASIEST managed by simply spreading out and NEVER stacking. If you stack you WILL die.\n\nWHILE all of this is happening Orbs will enter the room with a random colour and these must be your 100% focus! Kill the orbs! The boss isn't going anywhere, get them down at all costs. You can take as long as you need passively killing the boss but those orbs have got to go!\n\nAnd finally (the trickiest mechanic in this fight) the walls are back...they are smaller walls, so you can run AROUND them rather than killing the ghosts, but you are going to get  LOADS of them coming from many different directions.\n\nIf you hang on the edges too much or in a corner you run a massive risk of them spawning where you are standing so do NOT hug the edges!\n\nWhen the walls come in, keep an eye on the orbs and kill them, keep an eye on the mechanics avoid them, keep damage on the boss, STAY spread out AND walk around the walls.\n\nThis takes a lot of focus and ZERO panic. If you panic you will die.\n\nAgain to repeat, there is NO rush. Take your time, avoid the walls and keep doing what you are doing until that boss is dead.\n\nStacking, over burning without looking, and panic will kill you all!\n\nFocus! And GOOD LUCK!\n\n"

The tank should hold the boss dead center of the area and hold the Minotaur on top of the boss. Focus down the Minotaur first as the group but stay OUT of it's face, then proceed to beat down the boss.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The boss will occasionally heavy attack. This simply needs to be blocked regardless of who the target is. However, this SHOULD be on the tank. Don't drop taunt. There is no reason for anyone to be running around the room on this fight.\n\n|cffff00Siege|r - The boss cast an ability at 50% health which will create a siege shield type effect for protection while all around is chaos. Barrages of trebuchet type damage will be surrounding the room after a brief knock back attack.\n\nThis is quite easy to work with. Simply get inside the shield and stack and burn the boss.\n\n|cffff00Ground aoe|r - The boss will occasionally put a negative aoe on the ground. This is a pretty small circle and can be easily avoided by simply stepping out of it. No need to dodge roll and run like mad, just move out of it and you will be safe.\n\n"

He is hard to keep still, has plenty of aoe effects and some nasty one shots if you are not careful. An easy way to manage this boss is for the tank to hold it near the gate with their back to the gate itself. The tank should plant their feet and hold their ground while the group surrounds the mammoth from behind.\n\n|cffff00Trample|r - During the fight the mammoth will try to trample/charge down it's opponents with a long ranged ground aoe charge ability (typical of sword and board enemies but MUCH larger). So long as the tank has the mammoth faced to the gate, it pretty much has no where to go so will just bounce off the game. The tank should block this. If for some reason the boss goes loose and this is aimed a different direction, the group MUST avoid it.\n\n|cffff00Headbutt|r - During the fight the boss will attempt to heavy attack the person with agro (should be the tank) with a big swinging headbutt trying to hit with his tusks. This is quite a lot animation so easy to spot. When this happens the tank MUST block.\n\n|cffff00Flames!|r - The whole way through this encounter there are minions up on the mountains which you cannot kill. They will constantly cast ground moving flame aoes at the group from the left and the right. Don't panic, simply step out of them and weave between them as they come towards you.\n\n|cffff00STOMP!|r - This mechanic is crucial! At low health (under 50% or so depending on dps and overlapping mechanics) the mammoth will rise up onto his back legs and do a massive stomp! Every member of the group needs to block NOW, or take a one shot! Do not miss this mechanic!\n\n"

The tank should try to agro all 3 adds to start with and hold them together as much as possible. Since 2 of them are ranged this becomes difficult to manipulate so what we did in the video is to get the tank to grab the melee add, and place it on top of the archer! This stops the fight being too split up.\n\n|cffff00Circle of death|r - The area is a swirling circle of nastiness. Do NOT leave the circle. If you do, you will die from HEAVY damage. This is where running away will kill you!\n\n|cffff00Mini bosses|r - There are 3 mini bosses/enemies in the room, an archer, a mage and a melee enemy. The melee should be stacked on the archer and the mage dealt with separately (kill this one first).\n\nEach enemy has interruptible mechanics which MUST be interrupted if they are channeling. The mage will cause high damage and cc, and the archer can cause a VERY nasty flame dot. The melee on the other hand has a huge aoe that must be avoided. Be aware of these when you are fighting them. If you do not kill/knock them to 0% fast enough they will enrage and get much stronger. They are still manageable but the interrupts are even MORE important at this stage else they are going to one shot you almost guaranteed.\n\n|cffff00Lights|r - Each of the 3 enemies you knock down to 0% health they will sit down and have a green circle under their feet. This must be picked up by a player by walking over it (this will alter their screen visuals , apply a snare and do damage over time). Once picked up it must be deposited into one of the 3 lights surrounding the area. Each pick up will put out ONE light. Once you have all 3, pay attention to the middle of the room where the bone colossus (main boss) will come out from the middle.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The main boss has a heavy attack with a sizeable knock back. This must be blocked! The tank needs to taunt the boss at all times because if a dps or healer receives this attack they are likely to die.\n\n|cffff00Ghosts|r - Ghosts will spawn and spin around the room, if you touch these they will fear you. So watch your feet. These are immune to all damage.\n\n|cffff00Skeleton|r - During the fight with the main boss, skeletons will appear, be sure to kill these as soon as possible, they do a LOT of damage. Lay off the boss and get the adds, down.\n\n|cffff00Ice Comet!|r - During the fight the boss will raise his hands and each member of the group will be followed by a massive attached aoe effect. You must spread out, do NOT overlap them and hold block until the ice comet lands on each player. If you fail to block you will be killed or take huge damage and be stunned. If you overlap them you will of course take double damage and die. Be careful, spacial awareness is required here.\n\nOnce the boss reaches 51% health he will de-spawn, and the original mini bosses will re-appear in their original locations. Repeat the whole starting process again until they are all down, and all the lights have been put out (just as you already did at the beginning). The boss will come back out of the middle and it is just a case of now killing him. No more additional mechanics to the ones you have already seen.\n\n"

The boss should be held still by the tank and turned away from the group at all times! The group can then stand behind the boss in a semi circle while attempting to kill it. DO NOT run around the room. Running around will make a mess of this fight very quickly once the adds come in.\n\n|cffff00Breath|r - The boss will cast a negative frontal cone shaped aoe which does fast, high damage over time to anyone caught in it. A tank can block it but dps and healers need to avoid this.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - There will be MANY undead adds entering the fight. The tank will need to pull these in as soon as possible and you want them to die CLOSE to the boss. This is where headless chicken maelstrom shuffle type players will fail miserably. If players run around the room, the adds will be misplaced, die in stupid places and the next phase becomes almost impossible to manage. Kill all adds quickly and CLOSE to the main boss...\n\n|cffff00Cleanse!|r - During when the adds die they will have a beam of light sticking out of their corpses. You need to assign one member of your group to go to the urns at the back of the room and pick up the cleanse synergy, then run back and cleanse as many bodies as possible. If all of the bodies are close to the tank then this can be done very fast...but if the bodies are all over the room this becomes a mad rush to get rid of them all and then it could be game over for you...\n\n|cffff00BIG BOOM!|r - Once enough enemies are in the room (dead or not) the boss will start to channel an ability and each player will have a fast spreading aoe under their feet. Do NOT stack up.\n\nIF the cleanses were done correctly you will survive and no explosion will happen, if you missed 1 cleanse then it will explode and you should be ok. BUT, if more than1 or 2+ bodies are not cleansed by the time the aoe hits its peek...BOOM you die!\n\nGet those cleanses in, don't go yolo dps burn thinking you can get away with it. Some can, but not many. Follow te mechanics!\n\n"

The room is tiny and co-ordination is KEY! Stay together as much as possible and you will do this in no time. Scatter around the room and you will fail for hours at a time. The tank MUST have a taunt on the boss at all times else he WILL one shot group members. So pay attention! He never moves so he will not start chasing people but he will hit from range.\n\nThe trick to co-coordinating is to decide which way around the room you are going to go. Generally most go left. when it counts, remember which pillar is on the left and you will need to travel to it together (more info coming up).\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack/Haduken!|r - During the fight the boss will heavy attack whoever has agro with a long ranged Haduken type attack. THIS is why the tank must NEVER drop taunt. If the tank blocks this, they will live. But if not blocking, or it hits anyone else, they WILL die. If you see it coming as a dps/healer and are quick enough to dodge roll you can survive it, but above all, the tank shouldn't drop the boss.\n\n|cffff00Flames (aka corners)|r - The boss will call up flames from the ground AROUND the room. Thats right you are not FORCED to go into the middle. This is the phase in the video i call 'corners'. The reason being, there is a small square platform on the floor. Each member needs to get in the middle as soon as possible and separate on to each one of the four corners so NO ONE is standing on anyone else. This is because the next mechanic is coming and requires your to NOT stack.\n\n|cffff00Suck in and melt|r - Once in the middle in position as explained above, the boss will do a large breath or suck in mechanic which will pull all members to him and you will hover in the air for a split second.\nWhen he drops you, you will ALL have your own dot effect on you which will drop multiple aoes on the ground about a second apart (same as the trampler Minotaurs). EACH member must walk backwards from their corners SLOWLY to place each aoe neatly on the ground. While moving backwards if you have no where to go and you are going to end up hitting the fire wall, continue walking but instead of backwards go to your RIGHT...ALL players must do the same. 'back back back RIGHT!'. If ONE member messes this up and goes the opposite direction, you will stack on a friend and kill them. If you don't keep moving the aoes will drop under you and stack up and kill you, and if you do not have corners, multiple players will stack their aoes and people will die...this is crucial.\n\nThe corners positions should be resumed whenever the boss is NOT shouting and NOT slamming and NOT in stone (coming up.)\n\n|cffff00Slam!|r - During the fight the boss will loose his temper and start smashing the ground. There will be a big aoe in the middle of the room and fire balls will fly across the floor. This can potentially kill any player not just from the slam but from the stray fire balls.\n\nRemember the pillar you assigned your group to stick to? Hide behind it, get out of the middle of the room and utilize the pillar to avoid the fire balls. During this phase if you are careful, peek your head out and throw down dots, taunts etc etc but do not stay in the middle.\n\nNOTE: be careful as the fire/corners phase can happen after or DURING this (sometimes mechanics overlap depending on group dps) so be ready to get into the middle as soon as he is finished.\n\nBasically at this point we have clearly established that you pretty much hug your corner spots when the fire is on the outside of the room, and the rest of the time, hug your pillar.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - During the fight the boss will turn to stone and 4 elemental atronachs will spawn. These MUST be focused. i would highly recommend using ultimates at this stage to kill them fast before Domihaus wakes up.\n\n|cffff00SHOUT!!!|r - THIS is the difference between winning and losing. Pay attention to that pillar you chose because you are going to need it!\nat 70%, 50%, 30%, 10% and 5% health the boss will 'SHOUT' (then once a minute until the fight is over, you dead or him) when he does this you will ALL have to hide behind a pillar. The trick to this is co-ordination. Each pillar that has a player behind it will be destroyed when he shouts, so all stay behind the same one and you will only loose one pillar at a time. Once the pillar is down, you all focus on the NEXT pillar to your left as the NEXT safe spot for the remainder of the fight. Once that pillar is down, move to the next and so on.\n\nTwo things to note. Hard mode removes two pillars in the room from the beginning. And also, if you do not hide during the shout you are DEAD!\n\n|cffff00Execute|r - At very low health the boss will gain a damage shield and spawn adds. THIS is crucial. Adds will spawn every minute from now on so you MUST focus them down, all mechanics are in play, fire, corners, ground slam and fire balls, Hadukens, EVERYTHING. The tank is under serious pressure here. Hold the boss taunt, grab the adds and don't run away. The group needs to kill all adds as much as possible. Each time the damage shield of the boss falls off he will try to re-apply it prolonging the execute phase.\n\nMany groups try very hard to just push the boss and fail getting overwhelmed with adds on repeat. The trick to this is passive damage while clearing out the trash. Keep your dots up and Domihaus will gradually go down as the adds do. Especially if you have ultimates at this stage.\n\nNOTE: A lot of the mechanics can overlap if you have HIGH damage in your group. So the % of health dos not always apply because he can be going through one mechanic when you push him. So in these instances (as shown in the video too) you WILL have to pay even closer attention. Put on subtitles, it helps.\n\nWork together, focus on spacial awareness. Adds first, boss second...enjoy and good luck!\n\n"

Anyone that has dealt with large trash packs/pulls/mobs should be able to manage this. Make sure you are all centered in the middle of the room. Get the tank to agro as much as possible while you stay in the heals and damage. Chains/cc pulling will be required for this fight. Do not panic and do not run around else it can be a mess. The trick to this is keeping up as much aoe damage as possible to deal with all the tiny adds while dealing with the big ones.\n\n|cffff00Ghosts|r - The boss will spawn wraiths per phase and they will spawn on the outside of the room (quite far out) they will fire nasty high damage ice light attacks and also a fast moving ground based ice cloud. THIS must be avoided as a dps and/or healer. They will immobilize and hit for HIGH damage. As soon as these are in the room be sure that your tank pulls them into the center as soon as possible so they can be killed quick!\n\n|cffff00Bone Colossus|r  - During each wave there will be a bone colossus. These hit pretty hard and should be controlled by the tank but focused down by the dps as soon as possible. These have a nasty spreading aoe that BURSTS when it hits maximum radius causing high damage and knock down. You can block the damage to this but still get knocked down, or you can simply dodge roll/run out of the aoe.\n\nNOTE: the last wave there are x2 of these, you should really save your ultimates for this phase.\n\n"

This fight will make or break your group! You will need to co-ordinate and STICK to your plan. If one person tries to be a hero this is ALL over! The tank should grab all three enemies and hold them together. You want to hold these as FAR away from the 3x wolves/dogs as possible so they have a longer journey to make. The reason for this is timing. More time to react and prepare for their entrance to the fight.\n\n|cffff00Tiger Senche|r - This is the biggest problem in the room. You should focus the Senche down as soon as possible and he will be pinned to the ground for a period of time. He can be taunted but will occasionally hit whoever he likes so do NOT run away, he doesn't hit particularly hard but you need to keep it close to the other bosses and focus it down. Once it is sitting down you can focus on the other two and remaining mechanics. During the fight the Senche will eventually get back up and be full health again! (if you do not have crazy damage). Here is the most important mechanic for the Senche. He will FEAR one player, which is 100% UNBREAKABLE! Once the fear is over the Senche will jump onto the player at their now current position and start chewing on them. The Senche MUST be interrupted instantly or the player will die! A tank can survive for a short period of time but a dps or healer will die in less than two seconds flat. Once interrupted, focus him again and make him sit down as before. Rinse repeat.\nIf the Senche is alive kill it, if it fears interrupt it. That's it. ALWAYS keep your eyes open for this mechanic.\n\n|cffff00Guar|r - This boss is not really a huge threat and can be avoided if you choose but to make things easier, kill it, AFTER the Senche. It spits poison aoes onto the ground that you must avoid. The tank should taunt this at all times and once it is 0% health , just like the Senche it will sit down for a time and then revive for another round. Simply put it down every time it gets up.\n\n|cffff00BEAR!|r - This is very simple and a lot easier than he looks. The bear is your main target. Focus it down once the other two are sitting down and do as much damage as you can while staying out of of his face. He will occasionally get a damage shield which you pretty much just have to beat down and also will do a nasty cone aoe heavy attack. The tank can block this but the dps/healer must stay out of it. Basically a stack and burn at this point unless the other adds wake up or the dogs come in! Dogs/wolves are ESSENTIAL, coming next...\n\n|cffff00Exploding Wolves!|r - This mechanic is crucial! During the fight 3 dogs/wolves will slowly move towards the group and focus on any player of their choice, sometimes multiples. If these dogs reach a player they will EXPLODE!. STAY TOGETHER!!!\n\nYou have two options here (this is the reason we stay so far back, gives you more time to co-ordinate).\nMethod one is, decide which way you are all going to move in a circle TOGETHER, in a tight circle around the boss and tank(clockwise or counter clockwise) without spreading out!  while keeping your dots down. Keep the damage up while moving around together and they will blow up either via damage of on top of the tank in the middle.\n\nThe other option is to have your entire group stay as far back as possible focusing the boss while the TANK has their back to the incoming dogs. When they get close be sure that the tank basically walks into them and they will explode and die.\n\nEither tactic you decide however the tank MUST be blocking, else the dogs will one shot them. They do MASSIVE damage and a dps/healer will NOT survive like a tank. Boom = dead!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 CALUURION |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis is pretty straight forward but all of the fireworks and shiny lights make this look like hell. He is a basic lich boss with a couple of extra mechanics worked in. The tank should keep it taunted at all times while the group make a nice circle around the boss ready to take on the next incoming mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Lich Crystals|r - If you have ever faced a Lich before this mechanic will be VERY familiar to you. Large aoe circles will appear on the ground which will spread from their inside indicators and when they reach peak they will emit a crystal and they will explode. This mechanic could NOT be any simpler...DON@T run around the room. Just find a gap, and stand in it. Don't let it touch you, that is all. If it does, it will hit VERY hard and stun you.\n\n|cffff00Splashes|r - The boss will fire multiple splash effects on the ground, unlike the Lich crystals which have a spreading aoe, these actually land on the ground and do damage on impact. When you see these coming, simply move a little to stand in safe places, do NOT run around like a headless chicken. A couple of steps out of the aoes will save you, running in circles will not. Control yourself!\n\n|cffff00Totems|r - During the fight the boss will awaken a totem in the room which will deal different types of damage to the group and also spawn different adds in the room to deal with. When you see a totem light up you must move together as a group, surround the totem in a nice circle and focus it down.\nSkeletons will spawn and need to be killed. When they are killed they will explode! Now the trick to this is to kill them ON the totem because their explosion will do additional damage to the totem. Once they are down, get back to the boss and back to your formation.\n NOTE during this phase you could take multiple aoe affects which are attached to YOU as a player (each person gets one) depending on the type of totem that spawns. DO NOT overlap these aoe circles with your friends, give each other space. All other mechanics from the boss still apply at this stage (yes including Lich crystals.\n\n|cffff00Root|r - Depending on the totem at the time, you may occasionally get rooted with vines (Lurcher totem) if this happens, you must dodge roll to break free from it before it explodes and hits you for HIGH damage.\n\n|cffff00Snakes|r - One of the totems will also release small snakes and one large one. Aoe along can kill these but it helps if the tank controls them. \n\n|cffff00NUKE IT?!|r - Nuke or not nuke?. IF you have incredibly high dps in your group you can get the boss down to low health VERY fast, it is possible to skip some of the mechanics so to speak, BUT this was anticipated by the developers, SO to prevent this, if you IGNORE totems and go straight for the 'burn' at 25% Caluurion will go IMMUNE to all damage and be completely invulnerable UNTIL you get rid of at least ONE totem. So, be aware that you cannot completely avoid ALL of the mechanics just because you are a skeleton dummy smasher, mechanics ARE important on this fight. ;)\n\n"

There are some nasty almost one shot mechanics along side a DEFINITE one shot mechanic and these must be paid close attention to. Even though the boss is relatively low in terms of health, his mechanics can wipe even the strongest groups.The tank needs to hold a taunt at all times, which of course goes without saying. Hold the boss as still as possible and do NOT dance with the boss.\n\n|cffff00Fear|r - The boss will make the ghost with him cause fear in a random direction aimed at a player, break free as SOON as possible to be able to avoid any follow up mechanics. Magicka dps players need to pay attention to their stamina sustain because sprinting around like a loon in this fight will cause you to die if you cannot break free of maneuver when required.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The boss will wind up a HUGE heavy attack which will one shot a tank if they don't block it. This must be on the tank and they MUST block or they will die. If it is on a dps for whatever bad reason this happened, they will need to dodge roll it or die (you won't block this as a squishy).\n\n|cffff00Flaming sword|r - This attack is very similar animation wise as the previous heavy attack and is usually done AFTER it but the sword this time will be on FIRE! When this happens, upon impact the boss will emit 3 very fast moving, medium sized flaming aoes in 3 different directions. When you see this animation as a dps or healer you need to step back a bit, prepare for the attack and try to avoid it by standing in an gap you can see. NOTE these can bounce off walls and come back so watch your feet and the tank must watch positioning of the boss.\n\n|cffff00Space Invaders!!|r - This is the way i described a mechanic in Bloodroot Forge also. Basically the boss will stand still and start channeling an ability. This ability will rapidly fire many many small fire aoes in the direction of the players. Just like space invaders avoiding incoming damage, as they come flying at you, wiggle left and right to stay out of danger. One or two will hit you hard, 3+ will kill you! So when you see him channeling, spread out! Shout 'space invaders' and get your wiggle on!\n\n|cffff00Chains of death!|r - During the fight multiple times the boss will send the spirit to the other side of the room and the ghost will chain one players feet and slowly drag them across the room. You MUST notice this mechanic as soon as it happens and the group needs to KILL the ghost before the boss reaches them. If they don't kill it in time, the boss will slowly walk over to them and eventually stab the sword straight through them for a guaranteed one sot. You CANNOT survive this.\n\nAt the end of the fight when the boss is Low health he will do a FINAL one of these following a MASSIVE uppercut. This is ALWAYS aimed at the tank and if you do not kill the boss before he reaches the tank, the tank will die to a one shot and then the boss will remain loose until you kill him. ALWAYS focus at this point, heals will not help the tank, finish the boss!\n\nNOTE: if the boss is in the middle of the room the tank will be uppercut miles across the room, giving your group plenty of time to kill the boss ( he walks slowly). IF however the tank didn't pay attention to positioning and tanks the boss in a corner, the tank will not have far to go from the uppercut and will actually die with in a couple of seconds because the boos is too close. SO, tank this guy in the MIDDLE when he is low health!\n\n"

Everything you have learnt so far is going to be relevant And some. If you do not have a grasp on basic mechanics (ie. cc, blocks, interrupts) then you need to familiarize yourself with them now because EVERYTHING will be used.This takes a lot of practice and massive co-ordination and no it is NOT a dps race. The faster you go the harder it gets because you can accidentally get overwhelmed and inevitably die. The longer it takes in some cases the better. Pace yourself!\n\nAlso note, the DRAGON is NOT your primary focus! So get that 'we must kill the dragon fast' stuff out of your head right away. The MECHANICS are the boss, not that bloody great bone thing in the middle of the room. He can die whenever you like, there is NO rush.\n\nThe tank must NEVER drop taunt, and must try to keep the dragon in the middle of the room as much as possible at all times regardless of mechanics at the time...\n\nFORMATION! This is KEY, the tank role is explained below but your group need to have their OWN locations to stick to in and out of mechanics. Assign each dps and healer to ONE crystal EACH, and leave the gate assigned to just 'gate'. So each person's crystal has a player name and the gate is it's own name. This will allow you to accurately call location of mechanics. THIS is key. Throughout the first stages of the fight it is KEY that your dps and healers ALWAYS hug their positions unless they have to move and if they DO have to move, whichever mechanic they have just dealt with...get BACK into your positions FAST! This is a MASSIVE room, so pace your stamina, you do NOT want to run dry.\n\n|cffff00Spreading poison!|r - During the boss will drop a small poison aoe under the tank (or whoever has agro) and it will grow and grow and grow until it is max size then it will vanish. Do NOT stand in this, it will kill you RAPIDLY. Not the trick to this is PLACEMENT. The aoe is PLACED so you can move out of it and leave it to it's business. When it is almost over the boss will place another one and repeat this process throughout the fight.\n\nLook at the ground. There are loads of bones piled in the middle of the room. Use this as your guide. Pick a corner of it. When the aoe is placed on YOUR feet, move (even dodge roll through the dragon to relocate) to the OPPOSITE side of the bones on the floor (imagine it is a square and you are just going from one corner to the other). When the next one is placed in your new location, the old one will have disappeared...SO go back to your original position... repeat repeat repeat. This will give you plenty of time and so much control of where the poison actually lands.\n\nDo NOT run around the room like a headless chicken panicking about where it should land because you will place it in HORRIBLE places and overwhelm the other members of the group.\n\n|cffff00Orryn's Ranged attack!|r - ORRYN is the boss NOT the dragon, i cannot say that clearly enough! it is essential that you, as a group keep eyes on that guy at ALL times! He will teleport around the room with a light blue aura following him so you can spot him a little easier when he moves from position to position even when he is up high ready to come down again. So use this knowledge to keep track of him. Above all, the reason you all have specific positions is to cover as MUCH ground as possible for this ONE MECHANIC! This is the most essential mechanic for the first phase of the fight. When he teleports onto the GROUND, he will be at one of the corners of the room, so this is when you call out a player's name (or gate) to allow the group to know where he has landed. Once this has been established he MUST be interrupted as soon as possible! He has a nasty fast paced pulsing single target spammy attack which hits all players. About 3 hits will kill any dps or healer.\n\nIt helps if a healer can fit crushing shock for this for interrupts(or even the tank if required) in order to help with long ranged interrupts, but is not essential. What is essential is that at ALL costs, that boss is interrupted every single time he does this.\n\nIf you are on route to interrupt let your group know, so that they can dodge roll any incoming attacks from him while he is loose. You can dodge the hits but it is very risky and high on resource drain so the faster the interrupt the better.\n\nRemember positioning is KEY, if you had to move to get him, get back to where you were after wards. No heroes! C-ordination is the most important thing here. You are a group, no yoloers :)\n\nThis mechanic happens every few seconds during the fight UNTIL all the crystals are down (coming up) so pay attention. No matter what mechanic you are in, this must be kept an eye on.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will fire a heavy attack at whoever has agro. This should ALWAYS be the tank. Now the tank can with stand the attack with a block BUT at the same time once it hits 2x Shalks will spawn under the location of the tank. So if you dodge roll this it helps to eliminate any negative effects coming up in the next explanation. The heavy will emit a small spreading aoe. If you dodge roll at it's PEAK you will avoid it. BUT the Shalks WILL still spawn.\n\n|cffff00Shalks|r - This is every tanks worst nightmare...SNARE! Nothing worse than a massive room where positioning is key and you cannot run/move fast. SO here is what you need to do. Firstly if you get caught by their attacks you will get snared to hell with a massive movement reduction speed and a nasty poison dot for 10 seconds. This is not specific on being NEAR the Shalks but being near and IN FRONT of them..\nSo the trick to this is CC and kill.\n\nRegardless of class so long as you have a root/stun ability to control them and keep moving away from them (without over manipulating the poison on the ground too much) you will be fine. ANY one that stands in front of a shalk will take damage and be snared so watch your feet! The most optimal trick for this regardless of group composition is to have someone in your group running 'time stop'. Every time the boss is about to heavy attack if you put a time stop where the tank is, they will get stunned for a few seconds and will die to ground based aoe.\n\nNOTE: GROUND aoe needs to be under the boss(basically ready for Shalks) at ALL times.\nWhen the Shalks are alive you do NOT focus the boss. keep dots down for passive damage for sure, but FOCUS the Shalks and help the tank control the room.\n\n|cffff00Ice Tail whip|r - The boss launch a massive 3x triangulated ice aoes in the direction of his choice during the fight. This is very easy to avoid, all you have to do stand in the gaps OR block it if you get caught. If you get caught without blocking you will be knocked back and take HIGH damage.\n\n|cffff00Crystals and bone Colossus!|r - This is health % based but the chosen crystal is random (85% 75% 65% 55%). THIS is why you don't have to burn the boss. Get familiar with the other mechanics and take your time. The faster you push the sooner crystal phases will happen and you can accidentally overlap them , which believe me you do NOT want to happen!\n\nOrryn will travel to a crystal and you can not hit it. You must kill the crystal as fast as possible! AND at the same time, small adds come out(which can be dealt with just with some aoe damage generally) AND a massive bone colossus. This is NOT the tank's priority. As healers and dps you need to know how to manage this.\n\nSO, As soon as you have seen Orryn go to a crystal, your group lead should call WHICH crystal he is at (this is whichever player name belongs on that side OR 'gate'). Be clear. When this happens all players(excluding the tank need to get over there as fast as possible, hug up stack and burn while avoiding aoes and get the crystal down.\n\nIF the bone colossus tries to heavy attack one of the players, they MUST dodge roll it or take 96kish damage to the face, do NOT block this, you will NOT live. So pace your stamina and be ready to dodge. Now, the heavy attack is delayed so wait until his hand is WAY up high and then dodge it before it lands...As soon as you see the sparks for the heavy attack count 3 2 1 dodge out loud. If you are early you will die, if you are late you will die. This WILL take practice.\n\nAbove all the bone colossus MUST be killed (stay close to the crystal so he doesn't run off agroing someone far away) but if the crystal is not killed fast enough then ANOTHER bone colossus will spawn from the same spot.\n\nThese crystals are where you want to be using your Ultimates. So if you don't think you can build up an ultimate between crystals, simply ease up on the damage on the dragon and BUILD ultimate on purpose, no matter how long it takes, there is NO rush.\n\nAs SOON as the crystal is down you MUST all get back to your original positions. During this phase Orryn needs to be kept an eye on because he can go to a random position in the room and require interrupting. Staying in one place too long together can result in it being incredibly difficult to deal with this mechanic so you MUST be aware this can happen during this phase.\n\nSo, call the crystal player name(or gate) get IT and the colossus down fast and then get back in position.\n\nThis will take practice and co-ordination!\n\n|cffff00Ghosts Phase One and Lich Crystals!|r - At 45% you and your group need to get OFF their locations AWAY from the walls and pay attention to the group leader's calls. Orryn will teleport to a random location (call player name or 'gate' to determine his current location. When you have spotted him you will see him summon a HUGE wall of ghosts and they will be coming straight for you. You cannot Block, purge, corrosive armour, heal or anything, these WILL kill you on touch.\nHowever this is where a new mechanic takes place. The gold ghost guy who has been helping you all along throughout the dungeon will appear. He will run to a location in the room of HIS choice and put up a gold wall of protection. You and your group need to hide behind this in order to protect you from the ghosts.\n\nThe way to co-ordinate this is once you have noted which way the boss is coming from, step back to the furthest part of the room that you can together (while the tank is controlling the dragon and the time stops are keeping the Shalks at bay and the damage stays on the ground! (yes a lot going on here)...Get your group to LOOK in the direction of the boss...\nOnce your camera is positioned as such, look for the gold guy and call 'left', 'right', or 'middle' to let your group know his location so you can move together as a unit and protect yourselves.\n\nEvery time the ghosts have all gone, get close to the middle of the room AWAY from the walls and get ready for the next spawn. Again calling the player or gate location of Orryn, spin your camera in his direction can call where the protection wall is. Rinse repeat until the boss is at around 5% and under in which case he will stop this mechanic and go to the center of the room for the FINAL BATTLE!\n\nNOTE1: During this fight 2x Lich crystals will spawn over and over and you will have to avoid them. This is a VERY mobile fight, don't waste resources dodge rolling. Simply position your feet out of them or if you get unlucky, BLOCK!\n\nNOTE2: IF you are the tank remember that anyone caught in front of the Shalks will be snared and hit really hard by a nasty poison dot. As a group or the tank, you can still stand WAY WAY back behind the gold wall. You don't have to have your face against, it, so long as you are in line with it, you are safe. So if you need to take the boss back a bit, then do so.\n\n|cffff00ORRYN!|r - Once the dragon is pretty much dead Orryn Takes over the dragon's body and the health of the boss goes back up to 50%! NOW things get STUPID! Keep your dots down at all times, keep CCing and FOCUSING the Shalks, keep placing the poison safely, keep avoiding the ice tail whip, keep avoiding the lich crystals, and above all do NOT panic.\nYou and your group need to co-ordinate more than ever now! Stay AWAY from the walls or you are DEAD! and remember to note who's side is who's! You will need these call outs!\n\n|cffff00Ghosts Phase Two!!!|r - THIS is where people wipe over and over trying to be too clever and/or panicking!\nThe ghosts, Just like before, will come from one of your assigned sides or the gate (so call the player assigned side or the gate as before) but there is NO gold guy to help you and NO wall to protect you!\nInstead there are RANDOM gaps in the ghosts. You will need to have someone call out where they are coming from first of all , AND have someone shout where the gap is for people to run to so they know where it is safe. If any ghost TOUCHES you, you are 100% dead guaranteed!\n\nThe trick to this is utilizing space. huge around the middle as much as possible to give you TIME to locate the ghosts, And the gap. Once this has been established, go straight for the gap asap! The sooner you get through the gap, the sooner you can spin around and focus back on the boss/Shalks/mechanics.\n\nIf you leave it to the very last second and let the ghosts come to you, you are at massive risk of them re-spawning where you currently are and you will die. Make use of your space and time!\n\n|cffff00Skeleton adds!|r - Constantly until the end of the fight skeletons will spawn from where the crystals once were. These must die, BUT they don't have a lot of health. They do heavy attack which can be blocked. The do root which needs to be dodge rolled to break free (this is a pain on resources so kill them rather than let them do this!).\n\nThe trick to this is remember, you should have dots down all all times to deal with the boss passively AND the Shalks...The skeletons will die to in aoe so long as you don't sprint around the room. AND the time stops you are using will allow you to freeze these at the same time as the Shalks...take your time, don't panic!\n\n|cffff00Death Breath!|r - Every Third ghost phase (technically sometimes 2 and a half) the boss will fear the group and make them run random directions which is NOT breakable. During this time the dragon will leave the room and climb up high on the wall channeling a huge direct attack.\nWhen this happens 4x gold circles will appear randomly in the room in RANDOM locations. Every group member has a spreading aoe under their feet. IF you do not each reach a gold circle and pick it up (one each) before the aoe is full (incoming death breath) the attack will hit you and you will die to a one shot. If you pick up the gold circle you will live. You do NOT need to block. You need to manage mechanics, WHILE grabbing the gold circles and be fast about it. Do not hesitate.\n\nAlso a small tip. Every third phase of ghosts, when the fear is coming, SPREAD OUT! the reason for this is if you are hugging the middle there is a strong possibility (and this happens a lot) that you will be feared into the poison and die!.\n\n|cffff00Bone Colossus!|r - EVERY 10% as well as the sh*tstorm of stuff you have to already deal with, you will get a bone colossus! That's right, the faster you burn the boss the more you get! 40% 30% 20% 10% you will get one. You MUST kill this fast and focus it. Remember if it heavy attacks you, dodge roll it or die.\n\nThis mechanic is important but because it is % based and not timed, you can take as long as you want per 10%. In fact if you are COMFORTABLE with the mechanics just staying alive, dodging ghosts etc etc, every 10% you can build up ultimate ready for the colossus so it can die faster.\n\nFinal Note:\n\nAbove all this fight is CRAZY, many many mechanics going on at once that you will have to grow to understand bit by bit before this becomes doable and/or easier. It is one of the most challenging pieces of 4man content in the game. Get together with some friends, stick to the same group and practice and learn together. Also one MAJOR important factor...you don't need 50k+ dps for this, in fact having less is sometimes better because you don't force mechanics to happen before you are ready for it!\n\nPractice, co-ordinate, keep on the interrupts, keep positions and clear call outs, and you WILL get this done.\n\nGear options: For practicing. IF you are having trouble, all magicka users can slot the Phoenix set, and tanks/stamina dps can slot Eternal Yokeda (for stam change the traits in jewellery to robustx2 and 1 bloodthirsty depending on build) This will allow you a free death as and when IF required!\n\nGood luck to you all!\n\n"

It is very easy to get overwhelmed in this fight if people don't interrupt OR if people try to nuke the boss without paying attention to their surroundings. The bas has lots of aoe and can make short work of a group stacking on top of each others heads, OR people running away. So stay close but don't stack. A nice semi circle behind the boss is fine while the tank maintains a taunt and turns it away from the group. Do NOT drop the taunt!\n\n|cffff00Ground Pound|r - If you have been playing long enough you will have most definitely seen this mechanic before. The boss will slam the ground on repeat doing AOE damage to the group.\nNOTE: although the damage looks to be frontal effects the damage CAN go behind him too. When you see him slamming the ground simply block to avoid getting killed. It is not a massive amount of damage but along side all the rest of the damage you can take at the same time from other mechanics, this CAN get messy. Block, wait for it to pass and then carry on as you were.\n\n|cffff00Uppercut!|r - This mechanic is so much fun you can actually forget what you are doing through laughing! Try to focus here.\nThe boss will uppercut a random member of the group throwing them INTO the air and then applying a stun. As soon as they land on the ground the boss will repeatedly smash them in the face until they die.\nWhoever is not pinned, needs to interrupt the boss ASAP to get him off of the group member.\n\n|cffff00Jump!|r - The boss will jump on ANYONE who tries to run away! This mechanic is in the game in multiple areas. Bosses don't like people running away! Cowards will get jumped on and stunned, do NOT run away (demonstrated in the video).\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - Ice Wraiths and Spiders will spawn in waves throughout the fight. The spiders fire poison and general light and heavy attacks so are not too stressful BUT the ice wraiths will charge at people, they will heavy attack people, they will stun and they will do NASTY aoe. YOU MUST focus these adds per phase.\n\nThe tank CAN taunt them and control them but be sure if you are the tank that you do not spin the boss onto the group while doing so.\n\nYou can nuke the boss if you have very high damage in your group BUT if you do, these add waves will overlap and it is extremely likely you will die. SO, my advice to you is to pace it. Adds first boss second, rinse repeat!\n\nAdds spawn based on health at around 90%/75% depending on damage output of the group (you can overlap easily if you have high damage, and then again at 50% and 30%.\n\n|cffff00I throw bricks!|r - Just like many other trolls will pull up a large rock out of the ground and throw it at a random member of the group! Now although you can mitigate the damage with a block you CANNOT stop the knock down. You will be stunned and knocked over if you get hit. So the easiest way to survive is actually to time it, and before it hits you, simply dodge roll away from it. Remember however, NOT to go too far away while avoiding this hit because otherwise he will jump on your head.\n\n"

The boss should be held in the middle of the room by the tank if possible. This makes moving around during the mechanics a LOT easier for the rest of the group. There are many phases in this fight which can happen one after the other very fast if you have high damage or are just simply not paying attention. Most groups wipe a few times before killing this one!\n\n|cffff00Archers|r - There are adds in the room several times in the fight and tend to be LONG ranged. Sometimes they will cast the bow ultimate effect where a player will be peppered with arrows over a very short period of time. If a DPS/Healer gets focused by this they will NOT live unless they are fast enough to dodge roll the incoming shots. When you see this you MUST interrupt them.\n\nThe easiest way to deal with these archers is to your tank chain them in so they can be dealt with at close range! The reason you tank the boss in the center of the room is so that when THESE spawn, they are all the same distance apart and they are much easier to chain in and control. IF you are holding the boss at one of the edges, the gap from the boss to the sides can be MUCH larger and you risk having to move the boss to get into range and by that time usually someone has died.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will heavy attack whoever has agro and this SHOULD always be the tank. The tank MUST block this, or die. If anyone else in the group gets this attack, they will die whether they block or not. If you ARE a DPS/Healer and this for some stupid reason is on YOU...you have one chance. A very well timed dodge roll or die.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - The boss will randomly charge at a member of the group and it will look like a heavy attack (Technically it is. While a DPS/Healer will NEVER stand up to his actual heavy attack, THIS one is designed for you specifically. When you see him charging at you, BLOCK! If you don't block...you are dead. (you can dodgeroll if you prefer but blocking is a lot easier if you are not good with timing heavy attacks.\n\n|cffff00Tether Bomb|r - The boss tether two members of the group together with a long black/grey beam. If this happens, the two members must split up different directions to break the tether or they will explode and die. When you see this, spread out, pop it, and then come back in again.\n\n|cffff00Flame rage!|r - The boss at 70% health will jump into the air and vanish. He will then land again with a flaming crash to the ground. When this happens you must spread out, wait for him to land and THEN come back in again. Remember your positions. Tank one side of the boss, everyone else in a nice semi circle.\n\nThe boss now has a damage shield and every member of the group has a negative circle around them taking constant fire damage from the boss. This will NOT go away until you get rid of that damage shield. Tank needs to keep up protection buffs and the healer needs to keep people alive while the dps show what they are made of during this phase.\n\nBe sure that as demonstrated in the video you do NOT overlap the circles. I showed you in the boss fight a very simple and effective formation. Utilize it. If you overlap, people will die. There is no need for dancing, running away, showing of doing the 'Maelstrom Shuffle'...Stand still and do as you are doing until the phase is over. This is a lot simpler than it looks but people wipe SO often.\nBasically the same as the shield phase in Maw Of Lorkaj.\n\n|cffff00Whirl winds!|r - The boss at low health (32-30% mark) he will make two whirlwinds go around the outside of the room in an anti-clockwise rotation. They are very easy to avoid, just follow behind them and go around the room in a BIG circle.\n\nOne MORE wind will also be spawned and this will be on a random player and this does NOT go anti-clockwise, this will FOLLOW the chosen target. So you must kite it. The easiest way to do this, is keep doing what you are doing! Follow those other two winds in a big circle while your personal one is chasing you and you will be fine. If you start running around crazy trying to avoid it you will inevitably run into it and die.\n\nAt the same time the boss is creating his own whirlwind in the middle of the room and it is spreading to a MASSIVE size. This is why you MUST stay on the outside of the room and not come into the middle.\n\nIf the random wind catches you, you are dead, if the two static rotation ones catch you, you are dead and if you stand in the middle, you are dead.\n\nThis is the simplest (scary looking) mechanic of all. Run around in a circle around the outside of the room until he has finished and then go back to the fight as you were.\n\n"

He can actually sometimes be trickier than the last boss if people do not focus on what they are doing. It can be straight forward or can be a complete mess. There is a lot going on so work together as a team on this one! Priority targets count for a lot in here especially in squishy groups where people are low health and/or have low resistances and such. It helps a LOT to have some mitigation buffs in here because there are a couple of mechanics that can sometimes not be so easy to avoid and CAN cause people to die fast.\n\nThe tank should hold the boss in in the middle of the room at all times to make the whole fight a LOT easier! The tank must NOT drop taunt.\n\n\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack/Steam|r - If you have faced Dwemer Centurions already in game (and if you are coming to this dungeon it is EXTREMELY likely) you will notice these mechanics right away. However, this is basically a very nasty heavy attack with a cleave. The tank should BLOCK this and make sure NO ONE is standing in it. Do NOT spin the boss around and if you are a DPS/Healer and you are caught by this because of your bad positioning, it is your own fault. This is for the tank, don't stand in it!\n\n|cffff00Lightning!|r - This is again another mechanic that all centurions do, When he puts his arm into the air, he will fire rapdi lightning shots into the air and they will land on the floor under the target/s of his choice. This is very easy to avoid. Simple relax and go around the boss in a circle while doing damage/healing etc until the phase is over. The tank can stand in it and block OR go around in a circle, depends on how squashy the tank is to be honest. But of course maintain a taunt at all times so he doesn't come out of that phase with a ninja heavy attack to the group.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - During the fight you will be presented with 2x adds in waves. There will be a spider, which really doesn't pose much of a threat but should be killed asap, BUT...the Dwemer Sphere must be killed at all costs! Get off the boss and focus these things down! If you do not kill the Dwemer Spheres and they start overlapping mechanics (more than one at a time) you will be in serious trouble. These adds will pick a random target (taunted or not) much like the hagraven in Bloodroot Forge (usually the stamina dps) and cast a fast moving ground based aoe across the floor. If you are NOT protected by resistance buffs, damage shields, mitigating effects or anything else to that effect and you are HIT with this you are pretty much susceptible to a one shot ! If you have 16k health or less with low resists and no damage shield from yourself or the group...good luck, you are dead. Avoid this at all costs and kill that add!!!\n\n|cffff00Shock Spheres|r - During fight the fight you will see rolling Dwemer balls/spheres moving into the room. Avoid standing in these. They have a fairly obvious aoe around them and if you touch them they will explode, do HIGH shock damage AND stun you and anyone else nearby. Remember, these stun OTHER people as well as you! That is crucial for the last boss, don't touch them!\n\n|cffff00Frikken LASORS BEAMS!|r - This is the mechanic that kills groups over and over again due to lack of co-ordination and focus, along side lack of understanding of the mechanics. It is not just 'avoid the lasers'... there IS a system for it.\n\nDuring the fight the boss will go into a dome/shield of protection. If you touch this shield you will die so do NOT touch it. BUT this works as an obstacle that can avoid certain damage in the room...\n\nWhen he is in the dome, there will be a small Dwemer sliding across random wall from one side to the other emitting a constant laser beam! If this touches you, you are dead.\n\nHow do you avoid this? SIMPLE! Look for the Dwemer with the laser, where the Dwemer is shooting from, you ALWAYS want to be on the opposite side of the dome. Look for the Dwemer specifically. Not just a laser from any angle, you must spot the Dwemer projecting the laser. Always have him in your sights so you can see where you need to stand.\n\nWhere ever he is, put yourself in such a position that the dome is between you, and it will block the laser and you will take NO damage.\n\nAs the fight goes on this gets increasingly difficult with more lasers and there IS a system to this so you can make it easier on yourself. Remember to always have the dome, between YOU and the DWEMER.\n\nHe will hide in his dome for the laser phase at roughly 90% depending on the dps burst of the group (damage can of course alter timings) and then again at 75% and 50%. After 50% it seems to push the laser phase every 20seconds rather than health afterwards (check the video he goes from 50% with a phase and then the next one is 43% and so on. It is 'timed'). Each phase under set health % however does present more lasers!\n\nSo any health % to around 75% will always be 1x laser, any time after up to 50% will be 2x lasers and any time the lasers spawn UNDER 50% you will get 4x lasers.\n\nNow the easy part. When you have more than one laser, do as you have been doing, put the dome between YOU and the Dwemer, BUT each one that spawns will be a a patterned rotation. So if the second beam means you have to rotate behind the dome going to the left, it will be left every single beam for that phase. If it is right, it will be that direction every single beam that phase. So always LOOK for the second one, which ever way you have to run as a group, repeat it for the remaining lasers until the boss stands up again. This makes things MUCH less confusing.\n\nDemonstrated visually in the video for those whom are confused.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 RIZZUK BONECHILL |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is another pug killer because people are not considerate of group member's personal space. Basically if you stack on this boss, you are going to die! The tank should keep a taunt on Rizzuk at all times of course but the tank needs to stay WITH 'Avalanche', the boss's pet. Unlike other fights where you would focus the adds, THIS boss, you focus the BOSS!\n\n|cffff00Teleport/ice damage!|r - During the fight Rizzuk will teleport from one side of the room to the other, this can be very tricky. While he is in his new location he will be channeling ice damage at the group and he MUST be interrupted. If you do not interrupt him asap the group will not survive, his damage is insane!\n\n|cffff00Rolling ice|r - During the fight there are ice affects which roll across the floor, just watch your feet and move away from these and you will not die. If you are high though you will take high damage!\n\n|cffff00MASS STUN!!|r - The boss will channel an UN-interruptible ability and he will cast what looks like a small blast of wind with no effect...however that is your warning to get AWAY from each other. Within 2-3 seconds every member of the group is going to be stunned to the ground with a small spreading aoe which will explode.\n\nIF you have spread out, it will pop and you will live. If you overlap the circles, the people who overlapped will die! (demonstrated in the video, do NOT stack up in this fight.)\n\n|cffff00Avalanche heavy attack!|r - This all about the tank, this should not be on ANYONE. His heavy attacks can be single target hits and aoe frontal hits so the tank MUST keep this guy away from the group at ALL costs!\n\n|cffff00Avalanche roulette!|r - This is called roulette simply because of the randomness of it. The pet will hit the tank rapidly from time to time with so many heavies and lights hitting one after the other and during this you will see different aoe circles under the boss. Technically these are the same thing but they alter in their visuals to show safe and bad places to stand.\n\nIf the entire aoe is solid, the tank should stand out of it (or face tank it if brave) BUT when Avalanche hits with a GAP in his aoe, you CAN stand in that section (sometimes half the circle, sometimes a quarter of the circle) and you will actually be unharmed! This is there ONE mechanic where the tank is somewhat permitted to disco dance a bit to avoid the big hits, BUT you must make sure this is not near the group of course (don't spin the boss on the group).\n\nIf however like stated above, you are a chunky tank. You can basically just block it and it's not an issue.\n\n\n\n|cffff00Tornado|r - Finally when the fight is almost over (low health on the boss) he as well as keeping up his rotation will show one more mechanic. He will cast spinning tornado type ice effects around the outside of the room. The longer the fight the more he will cast. These are extremely easy to avoid. They tend to be on the edges of the room, so just DON'T go near the edges. The part where this becomes difficult is if the ice stun is present, you are limited to room, so...watch your feet and don't stack up, but avoid the sides!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 THE STONEKEEPER |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is actually a lot simpler than it looks although he is a MASSIVE boss so he does look very scary. He can wipe groups quickly if you do not focus but you have to do everything in order and if you stick to it you WILL succeed. The tank must maintain a taunt at all times and the group needs to know what is coming. Yoloing won't help. There are also a couple of skills that can help in here but we will get those those on the way down as i explain the mechanics individually. (Note hardmode does not have steam, or the rat race with dps/tank/healer roles and is a lot less complicated).\n\nFirstly the rat race you have to do at the beginning before the boss fight is the SAME on non hard mode. But on hard mode it is a lot more complex, so bare that in mind.\n\nMechanics wise for the boss as a whole however is  as simple as 'kill the arms first'. THEN the real fight begins.\n\n|cffff00Face Blast Beam!|r - The boss will constantly throughout the fight be casting laser face beam shots at the tank (or whoever has agro). Block this damage at all costs, they can be fast paced and they really hurts. Squishy tanks will NOT stand up to this if they drop the ball too often.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Field|r - The boss has a small lightning field around his base. If you touch it you will take damage and be stunned. Try not to stand too close to him.\n\n|cffff00Steam (hardmode only)|r - The floor will be FILLED with steam causing HUGE damage over time. The healer's work will be really cut out here! Lots of heal over time is required, damage shields also help and it is AOE damage too for those abilities/sets that reduce aoe damage. This also applies defile so you must stay on top of your survival in these phases. They tend to happen roughly every 30 seconds and lasts for 10seconds, so there is a 20second gap between each one. Healers are finally tested in a hard dungeon mechanic!\n\n|cffff00Flame arm|r - The boss's flame arm will cast a flame thrower in the direction of whoever has agro (this should be the tank at ALL times) do NOT spin the boss around, plant your feet and take it! You can block the damage and the healer will need to focus as much healing over time as possible when this happens.\nWhile fighting the flame arm Dwemer Spiders will appear one at a time and should be killed. They are low health and really don't cause much of a problem. You can even kill these in aoe if your group has good aoe damage, but failing that, kill it, and then back to the arm.\n\nOnce the flame arm is destroyed a centurion will spawn and MUST be taunted asap by the tank and killed quickly by the group. If this heavy attacks the tank, the tank must block or die. If it heavy attacks a group member who is NOT a tank, they must dodge roll with perfect timing, or they are dead. You will NOT block it as a dps/healer, it's a one shot.\n\nFrom here move on to the spinning arm.\n\n\n\n|cffff00Spinner Arm|r - Just like the flame arm mechanics, you must kill this before you can attack the boss and during the fight Dwemer spiders will appear one at a time for you to deal with. Unlike the flame arm this CAN damage the group. The tank should block the arm whenever it does it's spinning blade attack BUT the group ALSO need to block when this happens (also while fighting the flame arm, this mechanic is very important). Every hit with the spinning blade will throw lightning shock attacks at the group (direct damage). The healer will have to work very hard to keep up here but when the shots are firing, the group should be blocking! If you are too slow or you don't block, 9 times out of 10 you will die. Group mitigation buffs for resists and damage shields help a LOT here.\n\nOnce the arm is down the next centurion will appear and again this MUST be focused and the tank MUST taunt it!\n\nNOTE: The boss is no longer immune when both arms are down, NOW you can hit the boss!\n\n|cffff00Rolling Spheres|r - These were in the Vault Protector fight. Very simple, they will roll across the floor going to the middle towards the boss. Do NOT touch them. If you do, you and surrounding friends will take damage and be stunned.\n\n|cffff00Dwemer Spheres!!!|r - When the boss is able to take damage (arms dead) the room will start to randomly spawn Dwemer Spheres! These spawn on the edges of the map and will agro random targets. There are TWO choices here to deal with them and neither is an easy task.\n\nOption 1: Get the tank to chain them in and kill them.\nOption 2: put knock back effect skills on and knock them OFF the edge to one shot them.\nStamina need to put on draining shot (bow skill) and magicka will have to use destructive clench/reach with a flame staff.\n\nThe choice is yours either way but i demonstrate the knock back tactic in the video with a bow. There is an achievement for it too. BUT do whatever is better for your group. While other mechanics are happening this can get extremely tricky so you MAY be safer with most groups to pull them in and kill them.\n\nThese also channel effects at once person of their choice in the group. If they are not killed, knocked off or interrupted the spreading aoe will pop and the person affected will take high damage as well as anyone caught inside of it. However, IF you dodge roll JUST at the peek of the aoe(just as it pops) you can avoid the damage. DON'T PANIC!\n\n|cffff00Spinning Flames!|r - The has no arms left and so now the actual sockets they were torn from is the danger! the boss will cast massive cone AOE flame damage from each one. If you touch them you WILL die. So, when this happens, pay attention to which way he is rotating and follow him. If you are in front of him OR behind him, it does NOT matter, stick with him and just don't touch the fire! This is one of the most obvious mechanics...BIG aoe, and spinning, 'No touchy!'.\n\n|cffff00Rat Race!!!|r - At 56% and lower(depending on overlapping mechanics) the 4x teleport pads will be lit up (the rat race from the beginning) all 4 of you need to get one each asap!\n\nWhen you get into the portal and turn into a rat, each member will have to figure out which role they are! In hard mode you have to work together as a team rather than just run and break terminals.\n\nWhat you will need to do is charge up by spamming your charge up skill (ps4= square, xbox = x, pc = number 1) on the lighting circle. And each terminal you need to blow up will need to be hit with your Ultimate to destroy it...TWICE!\n\nRole wise there are differences in skills (imagine these being 1-5 from left to right).\n\n|cffff002xDPS|r = Charge up, Resurrect, Ice stun attack, Fireball, Lightning spamable.\n|cffff00Healer|r = Charge up, Resurrect, Speed boost, Heal over time, Spamable lightning\n|cffff00Tank|r = Charge up, Resurrect, Speed Boost, Damage Shield(group), Spamable Lightning.\n\nFigure out based on your skills, QUICKLY who is who. Make sure the healer and dps stay together and a tank and dps stay together. Go in 2 groups of two.\n\nThe dps can kill the spider dwemer adds but stunning them with ice and then hitting them straight after with a fireball (demonstrated in the video).\nThe lightning spamable for all x4 roles can be used for small damage while abilities are on cool down.\n\nThe healer and tanks should use damage shields and heals IF required when you get in trouble.\nThe speed buff should ONLY be used if you are trying to get down tunnels to get through quickly BUT be sure that everything is safe first.\n\nThings to look out for.\n\n|cffff00FIRE:|r Large tunnels/corridors have flame throwers which come out of the walls. Wait for them to finish, THEN hit the speed buff and run like hell.\n\n|cffff00Spinners:|r Circular pads on the ground pop up to be spinning blades with lightning hits firing from them. Stay away from these and when they go back into the floor, quickly go past them.\n\n|cffff00Adds:|r Kill them at all costs. Do not try to sprint past them, do NOT yolo. Deal with each mechanic at your own pace.\n\nTactic wise it is really up to you what you do as a group BUT shown in the video is how we did it.\nSplit up as tank+ dps and healer + dps.\n\nCharge up your ultimates and split up 2 different directions following the lightning on the ground to direct you to a Conveyor/terminal. Along the way, keep your eyes open, kill adds, and avoid traps. Utilize the speed to get through flame corridors and eventually once you blow up the terminal, use BOTH ultimates, and then travel back to the middle and charge up again to refill your ultimate.\n\nNow follow another path to get to the second terminal, following the same rules as above. Once both teams have killed 2 each, you will go back upstairs and continue the fight.\n\nYou have 3 minutes. That is at least 1:30secs per terminal, per team. Take your time, Rushing it will cause a wipe, and if you die as a rat, you are dead when the group goes back upstairs. Team work is key!\n\nTIP: If both teams are efficient enough and all 4 members are back at the middle at the same time, the healer and tank CAN cast heal/damage shield for your next run to help recover in case you were hit on your first run and low health. BUT that is rare it will happen.\n\nOnce all 4x terminals/conveyors are destroyed the team will be ported back into the room.\n\n|cffff00After the rat race|r - After you come back up you will have to kill the arms again, remember centurions spawn after EACH arm is killed. You will have adds, exploding lightning balls and the steam still to deal with BUT there are more mechanics now as well.\n\n|cffff00Spinners!|r - That's right, more spinny stuff! The spinning blades from maelstrom arena round two, are in the room. These go around the room in a circle and if they hit you they will cause a nasty bleed. Walk round these or dodge roll through them to avoid them.\nThere is a massive issue with these however. If they go through the flame thrower from the arm, it will turn the flames into fire balls and launch them at members of the group! When this happens you need to block! Get that arm down quick!\n\n|cffff00Meteors/steam/fire|r - Once the bosses arms are destroyed, the same mechanics as before with the Dwemer Spheres are present along with the spinning flame affect the boss did. So everything pretty much the same as the first time apart from the spinning blades moving around.\nThis however is not the end of it, at 30% you will get meteors landing randomly with small spreading AOE affects to indicate they are on the way. Do NOT get hit by these.\nSteam/flame cone effects will emit randomly from multiple locations surrounding the boss, do NOT stand in this stuff! and finally, at 25% you will get your final Centurion, he MUST die!\n\nExecute panic for most people is a real thing. The boss will spin, adds will spawn, aoes will hit the ground...BUT there is no dps race. Keep doing what you are doing and passively even with dots around so long as you focus on your foot work, this boss will eventually die. People getting scatty and panicking will kill you. Take your time, learn the mechanics, relax and put them into practice. You can do it!!\n\nGood Luck!\n\n"

The tank should hold the boss still with their back to the portal and NEVER spin the boss around. The key point to this fight however is that the group should focus the adds first, not the boss!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack/Jump|r - A very simple jump/heavy attack which will be aimed at the tank or whoever has agro. Be sure to block this as it does knock down and a LOT of damage.\n\n|cffff00Flurry|r - This attack is a cone aoe in front of the boss and is a rapid hitting flurry attack. The tank needs to BLOCK this or die incredibly fast and must NOT spin the boss around during this attack. If a healer or dps player is caught by this, it is pretty much guaranteed death!\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - During the fight there will be many adds spawning in the room. The tank can of course chain these in and root them but above all the dps should dispatch them quickly and put full focus on the adds, NOT the boss. The boss health is what triggers them, so if you push the boss too far, you will be overwhelmed with adds quickly. Pace it! The adds can be interrupted if they are casting and are not immune to any cc. They are easy to get rid of but the less you have to manage with the better!\n\n|cffff00AOE Curse|r - This is pretty easy to see, a BIG aoe on the ground which should be avoided. Simply stay out of it. The tank will survive but the dps and healers will take a lot of damage especial if there are adds in the room.\n\n|cffff00Harvester!|r - At 50% health and below the boss will shout 'lord Warden, Aid Me!!' When you hear this GET READY! A harvester is going to be joining the fight from the portal. The tank needs to grab her as soon as possible and hold her with the boss, BUT must be sure NOT to spin the boss around in case he is in flurry mode!\n\nThe harvester must be focused with as much damage as possible! She will place aoe's under players feet which deal MASSIVE damage, and once it has fired, within half a second to a second will fire a second one! This one will kill you! If the first one hits you, you must dodge roll almost instantly when you spot it.\n\nOnce the harvester is dead, the fight is basically just finish the adds and the boss with no other additional danger.\n\nTIP: save all ultimates for the harvester!\n\n"

If you have high damage you are relatively safe but if not, you will have to stick to the rules or get overwhelmed. The tank should hold the boss very still while the group do as much damage as possible while he is in the face of the group. The tank must NOT drop taunt. If the boss does go loose do NOT run around the room.\n\n|cffff00Uppercut|r - The boss fire a HUGE heavy attack and know the target up into the air. Simply block this to avoid it killing you. It should only be hitting the tank, so be sure you don't drop taunt. But if you are not a tank and it is aiming at you, block and you will be fine.\n\n|cffff00Inmates!|r - The boss throughout stages of the fight will run to the pool and inmates will flood the room running from all of the door ways aiming straight from the pool. Your group must split up into 4 corners/sides of the room and pick up the green piles of goo on the floor. To do this you must synergize them. Once you have the target aoe on your cursor, you have to THROW the ball AT the inmates. The more inmates you kill the better. If you fail miserably you will be in trouble since if too many fall into the pool they will create a Flesh Atronach! If you are really slow at killing the inmates, you can end up with as many as 4x Atronachs in the room AND the boss. Unless you have a HUGE dps group, this is a very big problem.\n\n|cffff00Atronachs|r - These MUST be destroyed and are your primary focus. The tank should grab these as soon as possible and stack them on the boss. If a dps is being targeted by one of these all they need to do is block. They do not hit too hard with standard attacks. Panicking players running away will cause a wipe because they will be very difficult to control. The reason these MUST be focused is because if they are NOT killed fast enough they will enrage and one shot kill people one after the other, INCLUDING most tanks!\n\n|cffff00Spray!|r - The boss will cast a cone shaped aoe at the tank/group, this is easy to avoid since it is such a small angle, simply step out of it. The damage is quite low however.\n\n|cffff00Tenderize|r - Every time the boss comes out of his immunity stage (inmates) he will choose a random member of the group. A message will appear saying that he is 'tenderizing' a member of the group. This person is getting beaten to the ground. After a couple of seconds you can INTERRUPT the boss and stop him from firing his finishing blow. If you fail to interrupt it, the target is DEAD!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 GRAVELIGHT SENTRY |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is simple but VERY mobile. The tank needs to grab the boss as soon as possible and try to control him in the center of the room while grabbing agro on a couple of necromancers. Keep the boss in the middle as much as possible to avoid too much poison swimming!\n\n|cffff00Necromancers|r - There are 5 necromancers around the room. These must be killed quickly. If they start channeling/casting they MUST be interrupted. Every failed interrupt will result in an additional skeleton entering the room and you will have to deal with it!\n\n|cffff00Big BOOM!|r - The boss will do a huge aoe spin and knock back attack which will throw all members hit by it several feet backwards, 90% of the time pushing people into the poison. Do NOT swim in the poison for fun and think you will get away with it, get OUT FAST!\n\n|cffff00Beams|r - The boss will aim at the player with agro (should be the tank) aiming 3 green beams at them which close in together. These can be blocked and/or walked out of but if you are not blocking you can be stunned/knocked off balance by them. Avoid these if possible.\n\n|cffff00Poison Bombs|r - During the entire fight you want to keep moving. The poison around the room is firing out poison splashes/bombs which land in the room and make a rather large aoe on the ground which will stun you! Avoid these as much as possible but if you are definitely going to get caught by one, simply BLOCK and you will mitigate the damage and avoid the stun. Block these, NOT dodge roll and it will cost a lot less stamina, these fire very fast and are present throughout the entire fight.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 FLESH ABOMINATION |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is very large, hits pretty hard and has some rather unforgiving mechanics which catch out even the best of players. His health is not huge but the room is massive and the mechanics make you use the whole room. The tank should turn the boss to the edge where the cliff is and try to tank on that side of the room giving the other 3 members as much space as possible.\n\n|cffff00Hoavors|r - At the very beginning there will be two Hoarvors, and through out the fight one at a time spawning. These MUST be focused. You never want to have 2x Hoarvors alive at once. The poison they put on the floor does crazy high damage and if you stay in it for more than a couple of seconds you are dead. If you get caught by  2x poison aoes stacking on each other, that is almost certain death! Kill the Hoavors!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attacks|r - The boss will constantly be hitting the tank with a barrage of large attacks. You can block these but most of them will still occasionally knock you down to simulate just how big he is and how much strength he has, so plant your feet and if he knocks you back, hold your position as much as you can to keep him from dancing around the room. Try to manage your tanking area as much as you can and keep him in the dots from your group.\n\n|cffff00Hoarvor Splat!|r - The boss will occasionally run to the middle of the room, and 4x Hoarvors will run to the group members. When this happens, SRPEAD OUT! Everyone find their own coner fast. These deal high damage and you don't want to get caught by them OR overlap them. When the boss smashes the ground all Hoavors will be splattered by his ground impact and then you can continue the fight as normal.\n\n|cffff00Poison and undead Minions!|r - The boss occasionally will force poison aoe's on to each member of the group. Spread out FAST and get a clean location without overlapping any of them. They will explode and each player will be knocked down. ONE player, will be put inside of an aoe which is staying ON the ground.\n\nThis aoe is deadly, there is an outer ring to it pulsing with spluttering poison. you must stay INSIDE the aoe and must NOT touch the ring of poison on the outside of it. If you touch the edges you are dead.\n\nDuring this phase the boss will have his hands dug into the ground and he will not be attacking the tank while channeling this effect. Also undead enemies will appear which need to be killed. They have low health so are easy to deal with but above all, NO player should touch the poison ring. Once it has gone, the fight continues as normal.\n\n"

There are 4 Body guards and each have their own individual mechanics. The tank should grab all 4 enemies and try to stack them on the Necromancer. Hold agro the entire time and focus on NOT facing the melee enemies at the group. The group should keep interrupts on the healer bodyguard while focusing down the other 3.\n\n|cffff00Necromancer|r - This body guard summons skeletal minions and also a totem/crystal type item out of the ground. If this happens you MUST kill it before continuing in the fight else all Enemies will take TINY damage (about 10% of your usual output). This is why you want to focus the Necromancer first, Kill him quickly with ultimates and the totem will be no problem. But in the event of it spawning you MUST kill it.\n\n|cffff00Berserker|r - Dual wield melee type, very low health easy to kill, but watch for his steel tornado! Be sure to block it.\n\n|cffff00Knight|r - This guy doesn't hit very hard at all, but he does have a nasty charge ability which will knock down anyone caught in it's path. The tank can simply block this but other should walk out of it.\n\n|cffff00Healer|r - Very simple, this guy heals, interrupt him every time he tries and kill him LAST if you can help it.\n\n|cffff00AFTERLIFE!!!|r - ALL bosses will come back in the form of a ghost. SO this is why you want them dead in a certain order if you can help it. The necromancer will be in ghost form and not really do mch to the group. The berserker will come back and steel tornado whoever he likes and the knight will charge the target of his choice while the healer heals...\n\nSince they are ghosts, they cannot be interacted with! Cannot hurt them, cannot taunt them and cannot BLOCK THEM!\n\nThis is crucial to note. If the knight is charging you or the berserker is spinning, get OUT of the aoe, you cannot mitigate it in anyway!\n\nAnd clearly the reason we kill the healer last is because we cannot interrupt his heals when he is a ghost. So that saves issues for you.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 LORD WARDEN DUSK|r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis is quite possibly the coolest fight in the game!\n\nThere are lots of mechanics going on at once here and you must pay full attention and co-ordinate with the group. The tank needs to keep agro on the boss at ALL times, everyone must watch their feet and you need to communicate. Split yourself into two teams. One healer and dps and one tank and dps, and stay with your assigned team. This will make more sense once we get to the portal mechanic. This is a very mobile fight and the boss will teleport a lot so timing your ultimates etc is key!\n\n|cffff00Teleport Jump Attack|r - The boss will fire a heavy attack at the person with agro (should be the tank). He will jump in the air, vanish, stun you and then when he lands he will heavy attack you. When you are stunned break free and hold block to mitigate this hit. Even as a dps or healer, applying this break free and block will not do much damage to you at all. So just be sure to follow the mechanic.\n\n|cffff00Drain Bubbles|r - The boss will occasionally pull blue orbs out from the ground and they will be situated in the room in places of his choice. The longer the fight the more of these you will get so be careful where you stand. If you go near them, they will snare you, and drain your health rapidly!\n\n|cffff00Meteors|r - During the fight meteors will land on random group members heads. I see a lot of people trying to dodge roll these and either failing or just wasting a lot of resources. They will stun you if they hit you but if you simply BLOCK, you will mitigate a lot of damage and ignore the stun. Blocking is better for your resources, make it a habit in here to get used to. The longer the fight the faster the meteors come down though so be aware of them.\n\n|cffff00Machine Gun!|r - The boss will put his hands together and launch a rapid firing machine gun type magic attack at a player of HIS choice. This is where agro makes NO difference and the tank and the target must co-ordinate together! The target needs to position BEHIND the tank while the tank blocks the attacks. This is 100% line of sight based. If the tank is in front and the target behind, they will be safe, if you peek out from behind the tank or even stand in front of the tank or run away you WILL die! The tank has to be your physical shield and get in the way of it!\n\n|cffff00Portals!|r - The boss throughout the fight will spawn 2x portals. You must NOT touch these until the right moment, avoid them at all costs, but be sure to have your group split into two teams. The reason for the teams is because EACH portal has 2 lives! If two people go in, no one else can and it will vanish. If one person goes in during the fight without admitting they made a mistake, when 2 people try to get it later, only one life will be left...someone is gona die!\n\nIF someone makes a mistake and stands in one at the wrong time, get your team mate to deliberately do the same to the same portal. This will get rid of it and lord warden will issue a fresh one.\n\nNow the reason these portals are important is because when he decides to go up HIGH in the air, flapping his wings at the side of the arena...he is about to issue a massive burst of energy to the entire room. THIS will one shot every player in the room...UNLESS you get in the portal.\n\nOnce inside the portal be sure to activate the protection synergy one the way down, and when you finally land to safety, rebuff/heal etc to take the edge off.\n\nHe will later respawn more portals and you will have to repeat this process again. Remember, don't accidentally use the portals, you need them for when he goes up in the air.\n\n|cffff00Shades|r - At 65% health and 35% health the boss will vanish into the middle and 4 shadows of him will appear around the room. These must be killed but only the SOLID one can be killed. The transparent ones cannot be killed. And they will switch from one to the other.\n\nThe tank must taunt all of these fast to get the magic shots off of the group or you will wipe fast. If the tank has agro, absorb magicka once every so often will actually absorb the shots and heal the tank. Following this clean keeping up taunts and Absorb magicka spams will basically render the tank immortal and in full control. Note these shades have MASSIVE hit boxes and can be hit with melee abilities like taunts and heavy attacks from a VERY long way away. As a dps and/or healer, use this phase (so long as the tank has everything under control) to get back resources and/or build ultimate. You do not have to NUKE the shades, you can simply kill tem slowly and use them to build.\n\nOnce the shades are all dead, Lord Warden will appear again in the middle of the room (although OCCASIONALLY he does a sneaky teleport to the side).\n\nAll of the mechanics are present all of the time however due to the 65 - 35% stages it is POSSIBLE to kill the boss so fast that you never get a portal jump phase if you can push him to 65 - 35 - 0 fast enough, but THAT will take some practice. Learn the mechanics, stick to them, get comfortable with them and you will be just fine.\n\nGood luck out there!!\n\n"

Focusing on particular targets and positioning is KEY for this fight. There are 3 different bosses, they work together and can wipe people easily if you do watch for mechanics. The tank needs to taunt all 3 bosses. Stack the sword n board boss on top of the healer and stay AWAY from the archer. The archer can be killed last and must be taunted the whole time BUT you don't want to stand near it. Keep the enemies turned away from the group and focus.\n\n|cffff001) Ursus - Sword and Board Boss|r - The boss is the sword and board boss and needs to be the MAIN focus. The group should put as much effort into getting THIS boss down as possible. The tank needs to grab this boss, stack it on top of the healer boss and NEVER drop taunt.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will heavy attack whoever has agro (should always be the tank). This is an incredibly hard hit and MUST be blocked. HOWEVER, if you are dps or healer you MUST dodge roll it if it is aiming at you for any reason (agro dropped, tank dead etc). IF you try to block this as anything other than a tank, it is designed to kill you. Be careful and watch for this attack.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - The boss will randomly choose a target to charge at. Usually the FURTHEST target away, so do NOT run around the room like a headless chicken and do NOT run away. When this happens, the target must either block or pull off a well timed dodge roll. Then carry on as normal. If not blocked this will knockdown/stun and do serious damage!\n\n|cffff002) Rangifer - Healer Boss|r - This boss is as simple as it seems, it is a healer. This should be killed after or during the above boss. The boss will attempt to heal the others over and over so when you see the heals coming, simply interrupt her to stop it from happening.\n\n|cffff001) Strigidae - Archer Boss|r - The boss is pain! The sword and board is primary of course because of the one shots, but THIS boss must be kept at range as long as possible. After everything else is dead, THEN you can focus this one.\n\n|cffff00Teleport Strike|r - The boss will teleport strike from time to time so be aware of this and when you get jumped, be sure to move away from here once she lands. It is not a one shot but the healer should be on point with this to be sure damage doesn't overwhelm them.\n\n|cffff00Arrow Spray|r - The boss will cast a HUGE cone affect of damage at the group, simply step out of this!\n\n|cffff00Focus Aim|r - Strigidae will attempt a single channeled shot at a member of the group (usually the one with agro). When this happens, simply interrupt her.\n\n|cffff00SILENCE!!|r - This is the main reason you keep this boss at arms length at ALL times. She is surrounded by a BLUE aura. If you stand inside of this you will be 'Silenced'! No ultimates, NO magic, NO synergies will work. NONE! Stamina abilities, blocking and bashing works but everything else will NOT. Keep her at range and finish her last when all of the rest of the mess in the room is gone. She is very simple to manage when she is on her own, but if you are fighting the tank and the healer and she ends up IN the group with her negate, it will make short work of your group.\n\nAgain, focus on positioning. Tank and healer together, archer at range. Focus the tank and healer first and THEN finish the archer last.\n\n"

It can go one of 3 ways...VERY fast (if you have high dps) very smooth if you follow mechanics...or really badly if you don't know what to do. The tank should taunt the boss and turn her away from the group and grab ANY adds that come in to the fight as fast as possible! The rest of the group should semi circle around the boss behind her and stand still while healing/damaging etc. Pretty much a stack and burn fight but there are some mechanics you MUST pay attention to.\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - There are Stranglers around the room firing projectiles. You can kill these if you want but they don't really hit too hard so as long as your healer is alive and HEALING, you can fight through this. Also you can choose for the tank to range taunt them just to take the edge off.\n\n|cffff00Lurchers and big boom!!|r - These are essential! The tank MUST grab these as fast as possible! They will spawn throughout the fight and will run in with a heavy attack. A tank can block the heavy attack no problem but a dps/healer will die. So if you are a dps/healer and one of these tries to heavy attack you, you MUST dodge roll or die...do NOT run away! That will just make a mess of the fight and the tank will struggle to take agro. Relax, dodge roll the heavy attack and carry on.\n\nThese will come into the fight at health checkpoints of the boss, 70% 55% and 25%. There are coloured circles surrounding the room coming from the small sprigains and as per the trash you dealt with earlier in the dungeon, Lurchers who stand in opposite (different) colours will have a health debuff, so you CAN use this to your advantage.\n\nNOTE: When lurchers die they drop a synergy on the ground, these MUST be picked up by the group. The boss at low health (depending on how long you fight her for) will channel up an explosion and if the synergies have NOT been picked up, the players without them, will die. Be sure to pick up the synergies when the lurchers die. This is also why it is important to focus THEM and not the boss unless you have a group with HUGE damage.\n\n"

There are some rather punishing mechanics in this fight so people need to pay attention. If you break them up it is straight forward but if you push for overlapping mechanics it can be a wipe fest! The tank should position the boss in the center of the room and the group should semi circle around him NOT standing in his face and be ready for incoming craziness!\n\n|cffff00Elemental Attack|r - The boss will take a LARGE swing with his sword and it will be on fire (same as the boss before last in Fang Lair). Once this connects, fire aoes will fly out from the center and go off in 3 random directions (note these can bounce off walls and come back).\nAs the tank you should block this. As the rest of the group when you see this happening, you should simply walk backwards, wait for the AOEs to fire and then stand between them. Don't get hit by them because these can almost one shot players AND carry a short duration damage over time with them.\n\nAt 70% and under these will change to ICE instead with high damage and snare attached to them, BUT instead of flying out from the middle will simply move around the room like winds!\n\nAt 55% he will introduce lightning damage splashing on each player hit after hit until it fades, the healer must focus here and the group must NOT stack.\n\nAt 20% he will use lightning, ice and fire on rotation when he heavy attacks/strikes with his sword.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is the most simple mechanic. If it hits you as a tank, BLOCK IT, if it hits you as a dps/healer, you are dead unless you dodge it.\n\n|cffff00JUMP!|r - This is the most important mechanic in the fight and most have no idea how to deal with it.\nWhen the boss jumps up in the air, he will vanish and come back down in a LARGE aoe slam. The tank should be ready for this and either block it and/or avoid it.\nWhen he lands however he will release 4x fast moving aoes and each one is LOCKED on to a player. You all get 1x each! When you see this, dodge roll straight THROUGH it to let it explode and you will be unharmed. If it hits you however and you don't dodge through it, you will die!.\n\nSo in short. Wait for him to jump, when he does, get out of the way...when he lands look for the aoe coming YOUR way, and dodge through it.\n\nThis will happen at the beginning of the fight then every 30second and each time he lands will deal damage with whichever element state he is currently affected by (lightning, ice ,fire).\n\n|cffff00Archers!|r - During fight based on health (every 10% starting from around 90%) the boss will spawn archers in the room. As soon as you see them (as dps) you MUST focus these down and then go back to the boss again. Archers first, boss second. If you do NOT kill the archers there will be far too many to deal with, they WILL target the dps and you WILL die. It is VERY hard for a tank to keep up taunting all of these if you get overwhelmed and push the bosses health too fast. So Kill the archers at all costs, very much like the Matriach in Scalecaller Peak.\n\nNOTE: These archers are different elements. Depending what element they take form of (ice/fire) depends on what aoes will spawn under players. Once you kill them the aoes will go away. SO watch your feet, don't stand still and kill all adds!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 TARCYR |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is another pug killer! This is where a completely new mechanic to the game comes into play. You finally in a PVE dungeon, have to SNEAK!! That's right, vampire, legerdemain and all that stuff can actually HELP here! Apart from that part of it, as far as the actual fight goes, the tank should taunt the boss of course at all times and keep it faced AWAY from the group. It is crucial that Tarcyr never faces the group!\n\n|cffff00ADDS!|r - These are your MAIN priority for the dps to keep an eye on! There are adds throughout the fight and they will channel an ability. If not interrupted they will PIN their chosen target to the ground. If that player isn't freed via a synergy(shown by a very obvious green circle) they will take a heavy attack one shot and die. It is essential that these enemies are interrupted and/or your friend is broken free fast enough. The tank needs not to worry too much about taunting these because they can get out of hand, but the dps MUST focus these down as soon as possible!\n\n|cffff00Fire Trail|r - The boss will occasionally run wild into a fast sprint leaving a huge fire trail behind him. This is usually in the form of a circle or straight line, simply stay out of this. It can be a little tricky with the adds occasionally but relax and stay out of the fire and you will be fine. The tank should maintain a taunt at all times and once Tarcyr has stopped running, turn him away from the group and try to keep away from the fire so the group can reposition in a safe place. Do NOT run around the room like a headless chicken, it won't help. This is a dramatic yet simple mechanic so shouldn't cause too much of a problem.\n\n|cffff00Stampede!|r - This mechanic is simple but annoying. The boss will cause multiple ghost stags (aka Bambi) across the room at each member of the group. You can block or dodge roll this. If not you will be knocked down. These cause moderate damage so should not be too negative if they hit you, BUT during other mechanics this can occasionally prove fatal if too much is going on at once. Again simply BLOCK or DODGE this and then carry on focusing on the rest of the mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Lightning/Dancing!|r - This is a simple yet deadly mechanic. Tarcyr will rear up and repeatedly stamp the ground. The group will get hit with multiple shock hits and stampedes the longer this goes on. This is a VERY important and simple mechanic to avoid, all you need to do while Tarcyr is channeling, is INTERRUPT! If you don't interrupt fast enough, the group will be wiped. Pay attention. This normally happens upon spawning in each phase and sometimes after a teleport(the boss will teleport occasionally to get to a new location).\n\n|cffff00Mind Blast!|r - This is a kind of mind blast attack, and will be aimed at anyone IN FRONT of the boss. The tank can take this but a dps or healer will die in a couple of hits so be sure as the tank to turn the boss away from the group at all times!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is a charged up attack and should always be on the tank (so long as a taunt maintains). This will cause a spreading aoe under the feet of the target and then hit with a VERY hard attack once it hits its peak. As the tank you need to BLOCK this, but as a dps or healer(or even the tank if you feel like it) if this IS on you, be sure to time it well and dodge roll it before it connects or you will die in one shot.\n\n|cffff00The HUNT!|r - This is one of the most unique mechanics in the game to date. When you enter the room and also at 3 health check points this will happen. You must work together here and try not to chase each other around.\n\nA wisp will appear and you need to STAY hidden (stealth/sneak) the entire time. When the wisp lands you must activate a synergy and the wisp will move again. Do this 3x and then Tarcyr will appear.\n\nWARNING: If you use ANY abilities that affect other people, whether it is a damage ability OR a buff to your group, you will break stealth and be thrown into the air and dropped from a height dealing damage when you land. If stealth breaks 3 times, your last drop will be too high and you will die to a one shot upon landing. So remember, do NOT break stealth!\n\nFind your OWN space and do NOT hug up to your friends, they will break your stealth if they overlap negative effects. Keep moving and spinning your camera and stay OFF the walls.\n\n|cffff00Hunt 1 (80% health)|r: This is the most simple version of the hunt. Spread out, Keep moving and keep your eyes open for Bambi! (stampede ghosts). If any of the Ghosts touch you, you will be flung into the air and break stealth. Remember 3x is dead! The stampede spawns always 2 stag ghosts at a time, so watch your feet!\nDuring this phase you must NOT stand still. You will notice there will be ice aoes spawning under people's feet. If you stand still inside these and they burst, you will break stealth and be thrown into the air. Keep moving!\n\n|cffff00Hunt 2 (50% health)|r: This is the same mechanic as above BUT with a twist. Now as well as all of the above, 2 players will have a large lightning aoe around them. DO NOT overlap this aoe onto another player because you will cause them to take damage and break stealth. Keep moving but all have your OWN space.\n\n|cffff00Hunt 3 (20% health)|r: Finally the last hunt phase. Here you have Bambi ghosts to deal with, ice aoe to deal with , lightning aoe to deal with and NOW there is fire on the floor in the form of fast moving circles. You MUST keep your feet out of these. Failure to do so will break stealth and throw you into the air.\n\nThe trick to this entire hunt phase is to keep moving, keep your camera spinning to avoid the Charging Bambi ghosts, and stay AWAY from each other AND the sides. If you go too close to the sides/walls there is a strong chance one of the Bambi ghosts will spawn right on top of you and throw you into the air. Keep your distance from everything.\n\nFinal tip: Do NOT race your friends to a synergy. No one gets medals for picking it up. So work together, tell the person closest to get it and focus. If you all start running for it, you will over lap, and die.\n\n"

This fight will take a while to get your co-ordination down for the group and there is a LOT to think about but with a bit of work you can do this! The tank needs to of course taunt the boss at ALL times! Keep the boss faced away from the group while the group try to stay behind him and/or away from him. Position is KEY for the most part so pay attention to his movements and above all (this is for the whole group) put on subtitles!\n\nThe boss does MOST of his attacks in order, so you can predict what is going to happen next.\n\n|cffff00Dog Breath|r - The boss will cast a HUGE cone shaped aoe in the direction of the tank, this is basically what i call the 'dog breath' or 'death breath'. It lasts for about 3 seconds and the tank should block this and/or pop a quick mist form to take as little damage as possible. NO dps OR healer should be standing anywhere near this. So as the tank, be sure this is NEVER facing the group!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss does hit with a NASTY heavy attack which must be blocked by the tank. A dps or healer will not survive this so if for some reason this IS on you, dodge roll at the right time and you will be fine, else it is a one shot.\n\n|cffff00Plants|r - This is directly after the charge ability. The boss will slam the ground with a large aoe circle. Do NOT stand in this circle and once he has slammed multiple aoe damaging plants will appear on ALL islands. This is where you MUST be sure that no one stands on any islands or even too close to them. If you do, you will take massive damage and die! This mechanic leads straight into the next one so position is key. Be sure to aim the boss towards the middle of one of the islands (as the tank, have your back to an island).\n\n|cffff00CHARGE!|r - The boss will glow bright red/orange and charge at the tank! (or whoever has agro) simply step to one side and avoid it and let him run past you. On hard mode he will leave a trail of fire on the ground which the group must NOT touch, it hits extremely hard!. Try to have the boss aimed towards the center of one of the islands when this happens so that he is easier to position afterwards. After he has done this ability he will go straight into the next phase. Once this charge is finished, the tank should position themselves in the water, towards the edge of an island so that NO ONE is standing on any land, but there is room enough to get on it after it is over.\n\n|cffff00Shock Water|r - As soon as all of the plants have gone the group must rush to get ON to the closest island. The next mechanic happens extremely fast so focus on your positioning and do NOT stack (stacking will kill you). The boss will stomp the floor and lightning waves will spread from around him. The will hit the group and can be avoided and/or blocked else you will be knocked back. However not only do you have this affect to avoid BUT the water is not covered in lightning. Do NOT stand in the water!\nAlso during this phase lightning splashes will be aimed at members of the group and you should move slightly left and right to avoid them or take HIGH damage. Do not stack up as these will double up and do more damage. This goes STRAIGHT into the next phase so be ready!\n\n|cffff00FIRE!|r - This is the EASIEST way to wipe! If you do not pay attention to this mechanic you WILL die! The boss will glow orange/red just like when he does his charge, BUT this time he will be slamming the floor in a circular aoe effect. Do not stand in this circle. When the circle reaches it's peak there will be a fireball locked on to each member of the group. When this happens you MUST dodge roll. If you do not dodge roll you will be hit with the fireball, it will add a damage over time affect to you with a short duration but MASSIVE damage. Most dps players wont be able to take 2 seconds of it. You healer must be REALLY on point if someone gets caught out but above all, get used to this mechanic and dodge roll it every single time you see it.\n\nThis is extremely important for the hunt phases (coming up). The reason i mentioned above that you need to have subtitles on is because he talks when he fires this. He will say 'burn you like a crisp' and other flame related one liners. Basically whenever he talks trash about burning or fire, dodge roll the attack! As demonstrated in the video (note on hard mode this mechanic is a stomp with NO fire).\n\n|cffff00THE HUNT!|r - Unlike the Tarcyr fight...YOU are the hunted! Juffy will split into 4x shadows! And start to chase the group in the dark! This phase is terrifying!\n\nThe boss/s will be immune and the only way to get rid of them is to catch them in a trap! One player at a time will be the target and a trap will be placed. If you have the circle under your feet you need to be running towards the light. Once you FIND the trap, stand behind it and the boss will be trapped.\n\nEach trap can catch ONE boss so you will have to do this FOUR times! before the fight goes back to normal. The trick to this however is you must STAY together!!! Where ever the trap is, be aware of the surrounding mechanics. Each trap however has a delay on it while the helping NPC places a new one.\n\nThe boss will make the water turn to lightning, in which case stay ON the islands and OUT of the water.\nThe boss will make plants appear in which case run laps around in the water and stay OFF the islands\nThe boss will stomp and shout about fire/burning in which case DODGE roll the incoming flame projectile.\n\nWhile this is going on be sure to NOT sprint too much because you will run out of stamina fast, and just try to relax. If you have to do laps around the room and take your time so be it, but be careful not to lag behind. A really good trick for this as demonstrated in the video is to actually utilize the 'mist form' ability if you are a vampire. This will help you a LOT if you accidentally end up in the water or have to run across it while it is trying to kill you. It is a GREAT mitigation ability if things go wrong, and believe me from time to time they WILL\n\nThe boss will still do charge attacks, heavy attacks and breath attacks if people get to close so stay AWAY from them at all costs.\n\nKite them as far away as you can and one by one trap them until the boss becomes attack-able again and then rinse repeat.\n\nThe hunt phases will start at:\n80% health\n60% health\n40% health\nAnd 20% health\n\nMechanics can overlap a little however if you have HIGH damage.\n\nNote: on NON hard mode, there are no stranglers, and only ONE shadow.\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - During the hunt phase there will be stranglers spawning around the room, if you encounter these kill them fast else they will pin and chain people in and be REALLY annoying! They have low health so they are not particularly difficult to take down. However they will stay in the room after the hunt phase so don't get too complacent with these. If they are in your way, kill them!\n\n|cffff00Wolves|r - As soon as each hunt phase starts there will be a wave of wolves which must be killed (ultimates are best saved for this) and at LOW health after the last hunt phase, the boss will spawn wolves to fight with him while you try to finish him off. The tank should try to control these WITHOUT spinning the boss and the group should focus these down at all times. Be careful of their heavy attacks and do NOT run around the room. Control them, kill them, and then focus the boss.\n\nThis is all about team work, co-ordination and of course mechanical awareness. While staying away form the boss during the hunt phases, remember the THREE major mechanics, water, islands and fire. So long as you can keep an eye on those, you will be fine. Pace it, relax, don't panic and you WILL get this done.\n\nIf you can kill ONE hunt phase, you can kill this boss. It is literally 'rinse and repeat' every phase.\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\n"

IF you have high dps in your group be extremely careful because you will overlap mechanics really quickly! The tank should hold the boss still in the middle of the room and turn him away from the group at all times. do NOT run around the room. The rest of the group should be in a wide semi circle formation and stay AWAY from each other. This is KEY!\n\n|cffff00Burst and pop!|r - The boss will spawn a LARGE spreading aoe which does HUGE damage. This aoe grows and then pops launching several small fast moving aoes in the direction of the members of the group. This is key since these hit really hard and can potentially wipe the group. The way to manage this mechanic is to (as stated above) STAY spread out. Move away from the large growing aoe and when it bursts be ready to move left or right to avoid the floor circle coming at you.\nIF you stack up, the aoe will of course kill your group because you will all be hit by the same thing. Hugging each other is NOT an option. Don't do it\n\n|cffff00Blood Fountains|r  - The boss will cast large blood fountains under the feet of EACH player. Do NOT stack because these WILL all end up in the same place and you will wipe the group guaranteed!\n\nWhen these large aoes spawn under each player, they each need to move out of it! This will spawn several times each time you move until all of the blood fountains have spawned. Then you can get back into formation and relax awaiting the next mechanic.\n\nKey point here is to NOT panic, NOT stack and simply stay out of stupid. If you get hit you will take high damage and be snared. The snare is around the 60-70% mark so you are incredibly slow meaning that moving away from the next incoming burst is pretty much not going to happen, inevitably killing you. Avoid these at all costs and don't selfishly hug your friends. Keep your distance from each other!\n\n|cffff00Adds|r  - The boss will spawn adds into the room (werewolves) and these MUST be dealt with. This is where overlapping mechanics with high dps gets risky. The adds will spawn around the 80% mark to start with and then at around 51% and about 31%. The werewolves have large aoe effects that need to be avoided and also have a HUGE jumping heavy attack which will one shot a dps even if blocking! The tank must grab these as fast as possible and the group should focus these over the boss.\n\nAt 20% or so Archers will also spawn and these can add to the mess so at this point depending on your damage output you can either finish the boss or focus adds and pace it. But above all, the tank must grab these and position/agro them before the group gets overwhelmed with mechanics.\n\n|cffff00?ONE SHOT (interrupt or die)|r - The boss sometimes charge up an interruptible effect. The channeling is about 2-3 seconds so is fairly long, BUT this must be interrupted. The effect will always be aiming at the tank/whoever has agro. This will pin them so they physically cannot interact with the boss so you MUST as a team be ready for this. If you fail to interrupt the boss during this attack, the boss will finish the heavy attack and kill the tank outright no matter how much health he/she has.\n\n"

The tank should position the boss in the middle of the room and avoid going anywhere near the edges. Turn the boss away from the group and hold it still! In the mean tim you should split into TWO teams. Tank and healer is team 1 and the 2x dps are team 2! Remember this and work together with the mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Root|r - The boss will root all members of the group and if the root expires after it's full duration each member will take HUGE damage and/or die. The way to fix this is to simply dodgeroll out of the mechanic before it kills you.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will heavy attack whoever has agro (should be the tank, it is NOT hard to maintain a taunt on a standing still boss). Simply block this, or take HUGE damage and/or die.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - This boss will cast a HUGE cleave effect, the best part of the distance from the middle to the edge of the entire room. Stay out of this if you are a dps/healer and simply block it as the tank. It wont kill a dps if they are full health but they will take a LOT of damage. It is quite a long effect so hard to judge. Make it easy on yourself and just avoid it.\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - THIS is crucial! Stranglers are all around the room, in the maze and around the edges of the room. These will grab the closest target and pin them while draining their health. If these are not interrupted the player will of course end up dead, or be smacked by the boss while stunned...which of course results in the same outcome. THIS is why you MUST tank the boss in the middle of the room.\nTeam 1 (healer and tank) stay in the middle of the room and they will NEVER interact with a strangler for the whole fight...\nTeam 2 however (the 2x dps) MUST stay together at all times because THEY will be running around in the maze and the room and WILL interact with the stranglers. They will pin one of the team members if they get too close and your other member should be the one to interrupt them when it happens. Work together (as shown in the video) and these will never be a problem. A breeze to manage mechanic if done correctly, but a WIPE FEST if you have selfish show off type players. Work together!\n\n|cffff00Spriggans|r  - Team 2 this is on you! The boss CANNOT be killed if it is being healed. Throughout the fight the Spriggans around the room will be healing the boss rapidly. So team 2 needs to go together to EACH Spriggan and kill it to stop it healing. Generally there are two at a time. So go together, get them down and when they are dead come back to the boss. I cannot stress this enough as explained in the previous mechanic, BOTH players must stay together. Near every Spriggan is a Strangler, and they WILL  pin one of you until you are dead. You must help each other.\n\nDuring the fight the Spriggans will get deeper and deeper into the maze, i hope you have good navigation skills!\nOnce all the Spriggan phases are down, you can finish off the boss (around 30% health remaining).\n\n"

So be careful and watch your feet!\nThe tank should hold the boss pretty much in the middle of the room, or at least hold it still and turn it away from the group. Do NOT drop taunt for a second because you will wipe the group out.\n\n|cffff00Pounce|r - The boss will occasionally pounce on a random player player (usually the furthest away but not always). When this happens the boss will try to tear apart the person on the floor who is now pinned. This is where the boss MUST be interrupted to save the pinned player. If you are not fast enough your team mate will die to around 200-300k damage. This can happen to the tank as well so be careful! Base mechanics are key, 'interrupt' or die!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will throw out a nasty heavy attack at whoever has agro. This of course should always be the tank so the tank should BLOCK this. However if for some reason the boss is using this vs another player (dps/healer) you must time it and dodge roll the attack. You will NOT block this as a healer/dps...it will kill you.\n\n|cffff00Wolves|r - During the wolves will spawn in 3s every 20% starting from 80%. These can be debuffed with a taunt but don't always respond to taunts and will hit whoever they like, and they can also enrage so be careful. Do not run around the room if they are chasing you as a dps/healer. These should be focused down as a priority over the boss. The tank however can chain these in and root them so also of course 'time stop' IS an option here to control the adds. Kill the wolves then get back to the boss.\n\n|cffff00Wardens|r - DO NOT PANIC! I have seen many PUG sessions where people see these and either ignore them or run around the room in circles. Tip: neither works!\nThe wardens will spawn during the fight 2 at a time (excluding the first spawn which is 1) at the same time as the wolves and they are your priority targets. They channel nasty lightning attacks and confuse the hell out of the mechanics.\n\nNow, lets break this up a bit. They will place a huge aoe on the floor (they channel then fire it) stay OUT of this big aoe. They will also cast lightning across the floor which you must avoid(just move your feet all the time so these don't catch you. And finally lightning bolts will come from the sky. These land very fast and the next shot is just as quick.\nWhen this happens each player will have their own lightning bolts, so move around in a nice little circle (only a couple of feet or so) and keep moving so they always miss you until they are gone. DO NOT chase each other and do NOT stack. If you do so multiple players will put their OWN affects on top of other players, they will double up and die!\nYou MUST stay separate.\n\nAbove all the wardens must be focused before the boss is attacked again. During this time the tank needs to keep hold of any adds that come in and the boss and focus holding agro and NOT letting that dog go loose! Relax and focus on the mechanics together!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 ARCHIVIST ERNARDE |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThe famous PUG killer boss himself, get ready, this really isn't as bad as it looks but you WILL have to focus on clean mechanics. The tank should hold agro on the boss at all times but the tank generally doesn't need to be NEAR the boss. Just keep him busy and focus on your key role in this fight. Explained below. The dps need to stand in a spread out semi circle around the boss and get ready to move their feet as and when they need to.\n\n|cffff00ADDS!|r - These are your MAIN priority! There are two adds to start with. Either one can turn into a hulking werewolf and they hurt like hell. The tank should take BOTH adds into the left or right corner of the room near the stairs and face them against the wall as soon as possible. This is where the group need to focus on killing them as fast as possible. If you have very high damage and/or use your ultimates you CAN sometimes kill them before they transform. However, the tank needs them in the corner. JUFFY (aka the hulking werewolf) takes NO prisoners and his mechanics need to be understood. The tank must block the stomp he does and the breath should never be spun on the group. If a stomp aoe is incoming the rest of the group MUST get the hell out of the way or die to a one shot.\n\nSo in short. focus these adds and ignore the boss damage wise (just be sure he is taunted). These adds will spawn again and again in the fight depending on the bosses health (so be sure to NOT over nuke the boss unless you can really handle it. Take your time, there is NO rush!\n\nThe adds will spawn at 76% 56% and 36%, a total of 4 waves of adds including the ones from the beginning. Take your time if you need to.\n\n|cffff00Lightning|r - The boss channel a heavy attack on one member of the group which will result in a spreading aoe. Once it hits its full size it will burst. The player with this aoe should move to one side and avoid overlapping on the group until it is gone else risk wiping out the team. Simply move, let it pop and come back in.\n\n|cffff00Shield!|r - This mechanic is where the boss will randomly pick one player and he will suspend them in the air with a shield over them. This shield must be broken with damage from your group to release your team member. If you do not kill it in time it will explode and the player will die.\n\n|cffff00Rune Roulette!|r - This mechanic is very simple once you KNOW it, pretty much like most things but at first glance is incredibly confusing. Don't worry it is not as bad as you mite think.\n\nThe boss will have a rotating sequence of runes changing above his head. He is deciding which one he wants. And you will see around the room there are 12 symbols with a circle under them.\n\nHere is where it gets simple but you have to act FAST...Once he settles on a choice, the symbol will stay solid. Every symbol around the room that is the SAME as his, will light up with an obvious circle of light under it, and of course the rune will be there to see.\n\nWhen this happens you ALL need to go to 1 symbol each. There are 4 of each symbol in the room so be sure to get the right one. There are some to the left and right of the corridor, left and right of the stairs and at the TOP of the stairs (shown in the video, watch the tank).\n\nIf more than one person stands in the same room as someone else, the second person to arrive will die, GET YOUR OWN!!!\n\nAlso note during this phase the boss and the adds(if there are any) are all frozen on the spot, so you CAN still do damage and res people if required so long as you stay INSIDE the rune.\n\nSo in short...see which one he has chosen, go find your own that matches it...stand in it until the explosion goes off, and then carry on as normal. Failure will result in a one shot.\n\nThis mechanic is a lot simpler than it looks once you understand it, but this is crucial for hardmode on the last boss. So learn it ;)\n\n"

					name = "VYKOSA THE ASCENDANT",
					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 VYKOSA THE ASCENDANT (AKA CAT-DOG) |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is a pain in the rear end but hopefully this guide will help you. The danger in this fight is when people 'overburn' mechanics, stack up too much and/or don't co-ordinate together. You need to time your abilities and ultimates etc vs the mechanics. It's not a burn fest. The tank should hold the boss pretty much where she starts, and turn it away from the group. Do NOT drop the boss's taunt!\n\n|cffff00Put it on a leash!|r - There are two wolf pets in this fight, one red one and one grey one. They are attached to the wall via a dog lead/chain. The chain is a set length however and they SHARE it. So if the tank taunts both, they will only both reach the middle at most, but if you pull ONE, the other has a shorter leash. So the trick to this is to have the tank taunt one (the grey one) and then leave the red one alone for the group to focus. These both have the same mechanics so need to be paid attention too.\n\nThe dps should ALWAYS focus the red wolf on the left whenever it is active. Two things to note however. if the wolf tries to 'leap' you MUST dodge roll or take a one shot. Also if it tries to heavy attack you must dodge roll BACKWARDS. Do not stack else several will get caught by it but if you dodge different directions, it will follow you and spin and kill you and/or others anyway. Once the red wolf is dead, go meet the tank and kill the remaining wolf. They will cower into the corner for a duration and revisit the fight again later.\n\nThese are PRIORITY targets. Red one first, grey one second, do NOT leave these alive no matter what!\n\nWARNING!: At 20% health of the boss, BOTH wolves will be OFF their leash, kill them asap!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will heavy attack the tank. This needs to be blocked else it is a one shot pretty much. If it is on a member of the group it must be dodge rolled or die, but this should ALWAYS be on the tank, unless your tank drops the taunt (which they should NOT).\n\n|cffff00Bleed|r - The tank will be hit with some NASTY bleeds from the boss so the healer MUST be on point at keeping up heals or you will wipe fast. Heavy heals are key!\n\n|cffff00Fire|r - This is pretty easy to spot. Vykosa will cause a small aoe fire blast to hit the ground. This is shown by her raising her staff in the air. Simply don't stand in it and wait for it to pass. Standing in it will go HIGH damage overtime to whoever is in it.\n\n|cffff00Fear Totem|r - The boss will place a medium sized circular aoe on the ground with a totem in the middle. This will FEAR players and to get out of it you MUST break free. Preserve your stamina and don't stand in the aoe! If this lands on the tank, they may want to reposition the boss to the left or the right so they don't stand in it on purpose for too long.\n\n|cffff00Pounce|r - Much like the middle boss of the dungeon she will pounce on the tank or whoever has agro. When this happens she MUST be interrupted else the person pinned will be chewed on and killed! PAY ATTENTION to interrupt mechanics at all costs!\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - You have seen these in the dungeon already, you should know how they work. However, at 70% the room is SURROUNDED by Stranglers. Keep dots near the tank at all times so that these die. They will get up again of course but they do have very low health and can be put into a 'sit down' state very easily. This will prevent unnecessary stunning. In the mean time as dps and healers, keep away form the edges of the room as much as you can and if you DO end up there. Keep your dots up to avoid the Stranglers overwhelming you.\n\n|cffff00The PACK!|r - This is an extremely important mechanic! At set health % the boss will spawn 2 adds and then shortly after another 2-3! These CAN and WILL overlap!\nThe werewolves you have seen throughout the entire dungeons...you know the ones that one shot you? THEY are coming in large numbers!.\n\n90% you will get 2x wolves\n85% you will get 3x!\n70% 2x wolves\n65% 2x wolves\n50% (see below for warden mechanic) 2x wolves\n46-45% 2x wolves\n30% 2x wolves\n25% 2x wolves\n\nThe trick to these is to focus and even save up your ultimates for these phases. You can literally slow down on the damage and build ultimate per phase. But remember they are were wolves so you WILL get ulti back for killing them with the fighters guild passives.\n\nOne more VERY important trick is CC. Your tank can pin them while taunting them (which btw is incredibly challenging with so many targets and so much damage incoming) BUT what you can do as a group is have plenty of 'time stop' abilities available as demonstrated in the video to control them.\n\nThese wolves take TOP priority! If they heavy attack leep you MUST dodgeroll as a dps or healer or die (also demonstrated in the video).\n\n|cffff00Wardens|r - This is an extremely tricky stage now. Not only do you have the mechanics you have had already but at 50% you get wardens in the fight. So to go with the werewolf pack you ALSO have to deal with these. Just like the middle boss in the dungeon, wardens are now PRIMARY!\n\nThis is where you want to change your positioning as the group. Instead of letting all the wolves come to the tank and throwing down ultimates and time stops (cc) you will want to run to the warden who spawns near the entrance and focus him down. They have the same mechanics as the previous fight containing wardens (lightning splashes, aoes on the ground and enrage type mechanics where they do mroe damage) so you should already be familiar with these. They MUST die, and yes even before the wolves! Get rid of them at all costs.\n\nThey spawn two at a time at set health check points. These spawn at 50%, 46/45%, 30% and 25% and a final 1x at about 21-20%. These MUST be focused at all times. Watch your feet and do NOT stack up.\n\n|cffff00Archivist Ernarde!|r - HE IS BACK!!\nAt 30% the ghost of the previous boss will enter the room with his mechanics in tact! He will cast his channeling heavy attack which makes a spreading aoe, just like in the last fight. Do not stack, move to a safe spot and wait for it to clear so you don't overlap it and kill your friends.\n\nAbove all, the 'Rune Roulette' is not IN THE ROOM! Every minute or so he will start choosing a rune. When he has chosen one, all 4 of you MUST fine ONE rune each matching his choice and stand in it or die!\n\nTIP: be careful not to try and run near or through him (he is the purple guy in the middle of the room) he has a large hitbox and as shown in the video you can get stuck on him and end up dead by not making it to a rune in time.\n\nFinally:\nRemember all of these mechanics and put them into practice IN order and you will be fine but you will need to fully understand them.\nJust relax and pay attention and work together as a team, yolo players will NOT get this done.\n\nIt is not a burn fest, you CAN pace this fight. Under 20% health once the wolves are all gone, wardens are dead and the two dogs are gone, the only thing you have left is the boss.\nRELAX, execute panic kills people all the time, it isn't dead until it is dead. FOCUS mechanics and good luck!\n\n"

Get your tank to hold the boss as still as possible while turning him away from the group. Key point for this boss however, running around in circles will do nothing. So focus, plant your feet and move when you NEED to, not just because you think it looks cool (spoiler: it doesn't)\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The boss has an uppercut attack and he will hit whoever has agro (should be the tank) this must be blocked or you will be knocked down.\n\n|cffff00Teleport slam|r - The boss will raise his hand in the air and jump up into the sky! He will then land on whoever has agro. With a huge aoe splash. You need to avoid this and stay out of it, but when he lands there will also be rocks that fly across the floor OUTSIDE of the AOE. Even if you are out of the aoe, be sure to block when he lands.\n\n|cffff00Flying rocks|r - During the fight the boss will stop attacking and channel a casting ability. This will make rocks appear in the air and attack the group over and over until the channeling is over. During this phase you must block else you will be knocked down. These deal moderate damage but while knocked down if another hits you while you are down (too slow to react) you can end up dead. EXACTLY the same as the 75% and under phases on the second boss in Aetherian Archive.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 THE MIGHTY CHUDAN |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss can be extremely simple if the mechanics are followed but many think that they have to run around in circles and all will be ok...WRONG. This room is massive, so the more you run around the harder it is to keep people alive and control things. The boss needs to taunt the boss and keep it faced away from the group at all times. The hit box of the boss can be a little tricky so dps MAY want to highlight/tab target the boss.\n\n|cffff00Spit (heavy attack mechanic)|r - During the fight Chudan will wind up a heavy attack. This is unlike the regular kind. You do need to block as much of the damage as possible but she will spit at the target (should be the tank) multiple times in a very short period of time causing MASSIVE damage and laying aoes on the ground. Everyone must stay out of the aoes and the tank must not spin the boss around.\nNote: If you are a Dragonknight with wings or as a tank you have defensive stance or spell wall, this will reflect the spit back at the boss...this will take timing. You can also dodge roll it to some extent but timing again is key. Above all, be sure to block it and the healer needs to focus you.\nNOTE: if you are a dps and this is on you, you need to dodge roll 3 times, once a second(which will kill your resources) else you are dead...basically for the tank...DON'T drop the boss!!\n\n|cffff00Haj-mota adds|r - During the fight there will be haj-mota adds spawning two at a time. They are smaller than the regular ones in the dungeon but it helps if you can get rid of these else you can get overwhelmed quickly especially when they start diving at the group!\n\n|cffff00Archers|r - During the fight there will long ranged archers in the room. If the tank can manage to it helps to have these chained into the boss (careful not to spin the boss). These spawn over and over and if you do not kill them fast they will overwhelm the group!\n\n|cffff00Lightning Shield|r - During the fight there is an argonian with a large lightning shield over it. This target cannot be attacked by players, but will hit the group constantly with lightning attacks while it is alive...more below.\n\n|cffff00CHARGE!!|r - The boss will pick a random player and a big fast spreading aoe under their feet will start to spread...Don't try to run away from it, it is on YOU!. Remember the lightning guy above? well THIS is how you stop him. Take that aoe and stand infront of him.\n\nOnce the aoe hits peek..cChudan will take a massive underground dive at YOU. Just before it reaches you, you need to dodge roll. Chudan will go straight past and destroy the lightning guy and his shield. From here on out it is rinse repeat until it happens again, new haj-motas, new archers etc.\n\n"

The tank should hold the boss as close to the middle of the room as possible to prevent any long runs for the group(coming up). He doesn't hit particularly hard but there are some mechanics which can overwhelm the group quickly.\n\n|cffff00Roar|r - The boss will roar occasionally with a fairly large aoe around him, this does tiny interrupt/knock backs while doing high damage over time. Do not stand in this intentionally unless you are the tank.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - he boss will pick one person at random to charge at. Now this TECHNICALLY is and looks like a heavy attack (white sparks). The target chosen should block so they don't get run over by him BUT...if the group is fast enough, as soon as he starts running (note he must have started moving, the channeling before doesn't count) you CAN interrupt it. This will take practice, but timing makes this mechanic very easy.\n\n|cffff00Archers|r - During the fight archers will be added to the room, they will do nasty long ranged attacks and 'take aim' abilities which Can one shot a dps. if they start channeling a take aim they must be killed.\n\n|cffff00Trolls|r - As well as archers, each phase will had a troll added to the room. These must be controlled by the tank and if possible killed fast(focus adds not the boss, the boss is on health timers anyway). These can deal high damage and do regular ground stomping aoes. Don't let the trolls live if you can help it.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - Exactly the same as the behemoth in Maelstrom Arena, the boss will occasionally stomp the ground and rocks will fire across the floor around the room and if caught in the path it will deal moderate damage and interrupt/small knock back.\n\n|cffff00Wamasu Slavers|r - During the fight the boss will go Immune to all damage. This will happen based on his max health 3 times the lower he goes (although if you have crazy damage these can overlap and sometimes even skip the last phase). During these phases trolls will come into the room and ONE slaver needs to be killed so they release their Wamasu to help run around killing the adds for you. Be sure that you assign one member of your group to release the Wamasus ONCE per immune phase.\n\n|cffff00Spit/mudcrabs|r - During the immune phase the boss will spit on the floor. DO NOT stand in it yet. Look around the room, there are two corners to focus on. One of them with have a geyser of water firing form it, THAT is the direction you need to be headed towards.\n\nSo once your goal/direction is determined, that is when one member from the group (not the tank) needs to run through the spit and go straight to the geyser. The longer you have the goo you just picked up the slower you will move, you have 0 resources and you will take damage from adds throwing stray attacks at you, you will be chased by mudcrabs and yes the boss can choose to charge you during this stage.\n\nGet as close as you can to the geyser and then drop it. Let another member pick it up and finish the job. It helps if someone is healing you along the way because most die on the run. Once the geyser is plugged, the boss with go into a roar mechanic and he is able to take damage again.\n\nAs stated above, this will happen 3 times during the fight. During these times you must have your tank grab as many adds as possible without dropping the boss. Throwing ultimates after he is no longer immune helps push him to the next phase AND deal with adds fast. But the choice is yours.\n\nNOTE: As mentioned above, the boss has mechanics based on health amount. SO the faster you burn it, the more mechanics will happen at once and possibly overlap. So to play it safe, take your time! Focus the adds and empty the room and THEN focus the boss. Rinse repeat!\n\n"

Basically what i mean is, people look at the boss's health and assume it is almost dead so ignore all mechanics...THAT will get you killed here. You must focus mechanics at all times, ESPECIALLY during execute. Get your tank to hold the boss still and taunt as you would with any other boss fight and the dps in a semi circle behind her. And get ready to focus on whatever happens next. This will require a confident or at least competent tank!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - Easy to see this one, dual wield heavy attack! You see this winding up, you block it! Tank or not. This has a big knock back but if you are blocking it will barely scratch you.\n\n|cffff00Totem|r - The boss will spawn a totem from the ground during the fight. When this appears the tank needs to apply a debuff to it if possible (piece armour) and stack the boss on top of it. The group need to 100% focus this as soon as possible. During it's life time it will drain players of all their resources in a very short period of time until nothing is left and then keep you at 0. This MUST be killed, there will be one every phase (unless you skip phases with high damage). The start of the fight being phase one.\n\n|cffff00Spirit Phase|r - at 70% and 50% she will hide in her cage and be immune to all damage while summoning a spirit of a previous boss to fight you. First at 70% it will be Chudan. Be sure that you tank is WIDE awake for this since she will spawn heavy attacking and if the tank doesn't taunt fast enough you will loose a player to a one shot. This phase you can kill it fast and get back on with the boss OR you can take your time and build ultimate up. The choice is yours. Once the boss is dead she will leave the cage and the fight continues. This will happen again at 50% but this time you will fight Xal Nur again instead.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - IF you have low damage these can spawn before she goes into the cage at 70% however if you have avoided them spawning they WILL spawn afterwards when she leaves her cage at 70% and 50%.\nThese adds consist of close range and long range squishies and also one of the nastiest of them all, the 'Stone Shapers'. Remember the mechanics for these guys. They must be focused and they must be blocked if rocks are in the air!\n\nThe tank should grab as many adds as possible INCLUDING the Stone Shaper (infact he is more important) and stack them all with the boss and root them. Don't let the adds run off and power up in the amber plasm pools.\n\nWhile the adds are up you are very likely to get a totem. So if that happens, stack EVERYTHING including the boss on top of the totem and the group need to kill it asap or you are likely to wipe. You need a lot of aoe for this so keep your dots down while the adds are in the room. If you get agro from any adds, and you are not the tank, do NOT run away. If you run around in circles you WILL get hit in the back of the head, you WILL make a mess of it all and you WILL die...FOCUS!\n\n|cffff00Statues|r - When the boss spirits are killed and she is released 70%/50% she will curse ONE member of the group. They will have their screen go into some rather funky dream like colours and they will have all of their abilities changed to the same skill (no heals no damage, no buffs just one spamable). The group can see which statue around the room is lit up. SO the cursed one needs to let the group know they are cursed, and the group should all move TOGETHER to the correct statue so the one who is cursed can attack the correct statue. Breaking the statue will remove the curse. This will take serious co-ordination. You can reveal it for your team mate via a synergy but running together taking the boss and adds with you is much safer. This phase will also happen at 30% and below when she goes into an enraged state, so you must focus here.\n\nThis mechanic will happen as mentioned above a total of 3 times 70% after spirit, 50% after spirit and 30% and below at execute.\n\nSpecial note: So long as the tank has a taunt on the boss she will NOT curse them. So be sure to taunt the boss before she leaves the cage, else things get messy fast.\n\n|cffff00Execute|r - The final phase is what i call 'execute panic' people see disco lights and go crazy jumping around, do NOT do this. The boss at 30% and below will go into enraged mode and do a disco light type spinning aoe effect which will shoot roots at the players doing damage and slowing them down. You can technically wiggle a little bit to get in the gaps but so much is going on it is safer to just focus on your job.\n\nKeep her taunted at all times, keep the heals coming and keep the damage and rotations up and it is a lot more relaxed than it looks.\n\nKEY points:\nKill and control all adds.\nKill the totem at all costs\nCleanse the final curse\n\nIf you follow the above, relax, don't run around in circles and work together as a team, the execute is easy. BUT if you start panicking and running around the room, it is all over. You MUST focus on this final phase no matter how long it takes you. The aoe effects 'look scary' but they are not as bad as they look.\n\nGood luck!!!\n\n"

There are multiple things going on at once so people have to really focus and watch their feet. One of the major mechanics in this fight will prepare you for one of the hard mode mechanics of the last boss so pay attention! The tank should grab BOTH bosses (one with a ranged taunt and one with a melee taunt). The ranged taunt should be on the middle boss (Rinaerus) and the melee taunt on the melee boss (Orzun). The melee ogre needs to be moved AWAY from the other, they must NOT stay together. If they stay together, their negative AOE circle will overlap and they will get stronger and wipe the group. Keep the melee away from the caster at all costs.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r  - During the fight Orzun will throw out a nasty heavy attack at whoever has agro (should be the tank) If you are a tank BLOCK IT, if you are not and for some strange reason as a dps or healer he is aiming at YOU, dodge roll it on time (don't even try to block it he will annihilate you).\n\n|cffff00Skeevers|r - You have seen these already if you have gotten this far. The ranged boss in the middle will call skeevers to the fight. When Rinaerus is channeling he will need to be Interrupted, else the skeevers will spawn! So yes this mechanic is technically avoidable.\n\nThese are usually about 3-4 at a time and don't hit too hard but they should be dispatched quickly. Be careful of your feet because these will lay on the ground while dead and shoot poison from their bodies for a short period of time. If you get hit by even a couple of these they can kill you fast. So the danger here is standing on them when they are dead, not so much when they are alive. The tank can taunt, pin these if they like but there is really no need, AND you run the risk of having too many stacked up negative aoes. So realistically the dps should get these down fast and just stay away from the bodies until the aoe fades.\n\n|cffff00Snow Tremor|r  - During the fight there will be many moving ice spikes on the ground. Avoid these else you will be stunned HOWEVER!, there is a mechanic these are required for. There will be a small ice aoe in the form of a fast moving tiny circle heading towards you in the fight (each player will get this). When it happens you will be prompted with a message saying 'Orzun has targeted you with a snow tremor'. When this happens, find one of the moving spike filled aoes and DELIBERATELY stand in it. You will be stunned, the tremor will hit you and you will be broken free and safe (aoe explodes and goes away).\nIf however you do NOT stand in the ice at this stage, the aoe will catch you, hit you and kill you.\n\n|cffff00Ice Pillars|r - During Rinaerus will channel ice storm at the players for a short period of time and the ground will errupt with ice pillars. You MUST get behind these ice pillars as fast as possible and stay behind them until his attack is over. If you do not get to the pillars fast enough you will be snared to a complete stop and freeze to death. This phase you MUST be ready to hide or die.\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r  - If you stack the bosses they will enrage and kill the group. Also, if you kill one ogre before the other then the remaining one after a few seconds will enrage and hit MUCH harder (basically capable of wiping the group). So in short, push one boss to low health and then focus the other. Then try to kill them BOTH eventually at roughly the same time, or close to.\n\nStacking makes them enrage, killing one too early makes the other enrage. Simple!\n\n"

The basic mechanic of agro in this game is that the tank taunts, and everyone else is fine (excluding mechanics). If YOU as a dps/healer have agro you should NEVER run away from the tank. Bring adds/bosses to the tank and don't panic! It doesn't help and just ruins groups.\nWhy is this important in this fight? because you WILL get chased by stuff the tank cannot control and it is now up to YOU to relax, understand the importance of staying close and NOT panic!\n\nThe tank should hold the boss still and face the door. Everyone else (yes healers this means you too) should be as close as possible in a circle around the boss and get ready to take on the mechanics. No matter what happens do NOT start running to Grahtwood!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is extremely straight forward and if the tank has ever done Spindle Clutch II and faced Bloodspawn, this is an obvious mechanic. The boss will do a heavy attack at the tank. Block it or die. If this for any weird reason is on the dps/healer, then dodge roll. Block wont save you if you are not a tank.\n\n|cffff00Ice Wraths|r - These are low health adds which will spawn during the fight, these must be killed else lots of nasty ice aoes and knock downs will happen from them. They are not so difficult to deal with so long as you keep a decent amount of aoe dps down on the ground. The tank can taunt these but generally it is safer for the tank to keep focus on the boss. Do NOT run around the room, they will just chase you! Kill them.\n\n|cffff00Don't Stand In Stupid!|r - During the fight there will be large AOE effects on the ground, these are extremely easy to spot, simple move your feet and don't stand in them. If you do you will take damage and the healer will have to work pretty hard to keep you up. They are not one shots by any mean but they do offer nasty damage over time.\n\n|cffff00Bleed|r - The tank will receive bleed damage from the boss which the healer will need to keep on top of to cleanse/heal through.\n\n|cffff00Ground Pound|r - The boss will occasionally pound the ground in a small aoe under his feet. Do NOT stand in this.\n\n|cffff00Lasers|r - The lasers from the orbs will follow people around a bit, just move your feet and don't get caught else they will turn you to stone. \n\n|cffff00Spheres!!!|r - These floating balls of death will attack the group at set % of health of the boss. These spawn at 80% 60% 40% and 20%. These MUST be focused. They will pick one player of the group and go straight for them. The target will have a small pulsing aoe under their feet to indicate they are the target. The ball moves slowly but when it reaches them it will turn them to stone.\n\nThe trick to this is to keep aoe down where the boss is and stay CLOSE to the boss together. That way when the gets close to the group it takes passive damage at the same time as the boss. BUT as well as aoe damage the group should now FOCUS all single target damage on the ball to kill it.\n\nIF it turns anyone to stone, then you must break them free IMMEDIATELY. If you do not break them free the boss will channel up a one shot. This CAN be interrupted but he will enrage and get stronger, so the key here is to stay as close as possible to each other while avoiding aoes and the second someone is turned to stone, break them out with a synergy. After they are turned to stone the ball will pick a different target and so on until it is dead.\n\nNOTE: IF you run away, it will chase you and when you eventually get turned to stone (and lets face it most people are not capable of actually 'kiting' it away and killing it) they will be WAY too far away for the group to go and break them free and they will die before anyone gets there. Then the ball will swap to them and rinse repeat. Stay close together and you can recover faster, as shown in the video. It is much faster paced to stay together, everyone is putting damage down, stuff is tanked and heals are in one place ;)\n\n"

A very simple to understand boss but most underestimate the importance of mechanics and inevitably wipe on repeat. PACE is key in this fight. Over burning will result in a wipe because she has EXTREMELY low health and the mechanics pop up at very regular moments. The boss should be tanked in the middle of the room so that when you are trying to kill adds she is not in the way and you don't accidentally do additional damage to her while killing adds. The mechanics below will make more sense as to why this is, but again remember PACE is key. Do NOT drop ultimates on here at the beginning of the fight and expect to burn it, you WILL die (yes we have done it and so have many but it is really rough)\n\n|cffff00VMA ICE!!|r - That's right, just like the VMA ice round (arena 5) the ice water will KILL you, so STAY out of it!\n\n|cffff00Plug the ice|r - The boss will channel and a small ice spike will start to appear on the floor, the tank must stand on this and plug the hole or the group will take HUGE damage.\n\n|cffff00Fear|r - The boss occasionally fear the entire group making you run a random direction (yes sometimes into the ice) If this happens, simply break free and carry on as you were.\n\n|cffff00Leminids|r - The Leminids aka Lemonades are the key problem to this fight. IF you get overwhelmed with these you are all going to die. The boss has extremely low health for a boss fight such as this so as i said above pace is key! The reason for this is because these Leminids spawn every '10%'! That's right EVERY 10% you will get an add and HAVE to deal with it. At 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% you will get one of these spawn randomly in the room and the dps must switch their focus from the boss, to the add and fast. If the adds are not killed in time geysers will spawn. DPS/healers generally will not survive them unless they are full health already standing in heals. So it pays to keep some heals down at all times for the group even if they are not taking damage just in case.\nIF you over burn the boss you will get of course MULTIPLE Leminids and this will be hell! The light attacks from them will overwhelm the group and the geysers will be TOO much to deal with.\n\nWhat helps with these is if the tank can put a ranged taunt on them while staying IN the middle! Do not move the boss!\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - The boss will occasionally create a massive stomp like spreading aoe which you MUST avoid. The tank can block it but the group must move backwards and get out of it or pretty much take a one shot unless full of resists and damage shields.\n\n|cffff00JUMP!|r - This is why the tank should hold the boss still and not run around melee taunting Leminids. Always range taunt them and hold your ground. Whoever has agro (yes this applies to the tank dropping taunt) the boss will JUMP to them if they are far away. This means if the tank runs off to taunt something, the boss will jump on their head to catch them. This creates a massive quake attack in AOE from the location of the boss's target. You want to avoid making this mechanic happen because it is VERY likely you will make it land on the group's head.\n\n"

A very fun and active fight with some unique mechanics. The tank should hold the boss in the MIDDLE of the room. There are many things the tank must focus on in here (explained below) and being positioned in the middle of the room makes maneuverability much easier and there is less chance of taking TOO long to get to certain locations. If the tank is too slow, people will die! The group should stay behind the boss in a semi circle while fighting him unless of course dealing with other mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Poison grills|r - This is the reason i tell the tank to stand in the middle of the room at all times. The ground is full of grills. Each one has the potential to cause poison to fire from it at the group causing HUGE damage over a very short period of time. The tank must get to the active grill as soon as possible, sit on it and hold block to take the damage off the group. Every time the tank successfully protects the group by blocking the hole, the tank should get BACK into the middle of the room ready to block the next one. A lot of tanks make the mistake of standing where they last were (so they block one and stay there even though it has gone)...this can create a problem. If for example the tank is at the farthest corner of the room and a new one spawns WAY at the other side of the room, he/she is NEVER going to make it and the group will die. Focusing on hugging the middle and always getting back into position makes each run shorter, and less dangerous for the group.\n\n|cffff00Arrow Spray|r - The boss will cast a cone aoe in the form of arrow spray, pretty much the same as the bow ability players have in the bow skill line. This is VERY easy to avoid. He will choose any target he likes, simple don't stand in it. If you are hit you will take poison damage over time and die fast!\n\n|cffff00Fire!|r - The boss will cast a small spreading aoe on the floor. When this happens move away from it ready to watch your feet. Once it pops it will emit 4 lines of fire in different directions along the floor. Simply move to one side so it passes you and don't stand in it. If you get hit you will take HIGH fire damage over time.\n\n|cffff00Take aim|r - The boss will try to snipe a member of the group with a HUGE single target hard hitting ability. This needs to be interrupted as soon as possible to prevent a potential one shot to a dps/healer.\n\n|cffff00Making The Potion|r - This is all about the adds and they must be killed in ORDER! Jorvuld requires parts of creatures for his potions. He will call out which pieces he needs during the fight so it helps if you have subtitles on. Focus the boss at ALL times, unless he asks for specific pieces. Firstly you will need to kill Imps, then the second phase you will have to kill Stranglers and on the 3rd phase you will have to kill Beetles. Each phase the room will be full of poison and your healers will simply have to keep you alive while you focus the boss and the required adds. Once he has all the pieces he needs he will throw a potion into the room. The boss at this stage will be stunned and there will be a POSITIVE aoe in the room. Stand in this together asap and you will be granted with a HUGE bonus and cleansed of the poison.\n\nThe bonuses you can receive are Increased damage and recovery and also increased damage and ultimate regen speed. During this phase you want to burn the boss to hell and back as your damage output is almost doubled! \n\n|cffff00Guard|r - While the boss is pinned by the potion from Jorvuld a guard will run into the fight. He has fairly high health for an add and hits with one shot heavy attacks if not block. As soon as the tank spots this, he should be pulled to the boss and stacked with him. If the dps focuses you can kill this add rapidly with your damage increase buff before it runs out. Failing that, focus him first before continuing with the boss.\n\n"

The tank needs to focus on holding the boss and turning her away from the group at all times, NO SPINNING! and also when the adds are in the room you must of course taunt them and hold them still too. Each member must know exactly what they are doing, understand each phase and be ready for them. Yoloers and heroes will cause nothing but failure in this fight. Work together!\n\nFormation wise i make a very clear demonstration in the video about how you should stand. Stand in line with the gap between the middle dragon and the right dragon in a STRAIGHT line. This will prepare you for ALL mechanics i am about to explain!\n\n|cffff00Leminid and Atronach|r - There are two adds with lowish health, a Lemonid and a Frost Atronach. These must die BUT be careful. Once the Atronach dies it will drop the ICE mechanic (moving spikes) from the first boss. DO NOT stand in it. And once the Leminid dies, she will drop a poison geyser...do NOT stand in this! If you stand in either of these they will stun you and you will take this effect out of the room. YOU NEED THIS!\nWhile killing the adds be sure that they are stacked on the boss (use ultimates on the adds always) and keep the heals heavy. The main problem with this hard mode as far as incoming damage is concerned is the amount of aoe dot damage. So hots are essential. Anything that hits directly is a one shot so spamming breath of life is a waste of time, and generally too late.\n\nSO again to recap, stack the adds, use ultimates if you have them, when they die, AVOID the aoe they drop and stay in your formation. The ice will move around so watch your feet. These adds spawn EVERY time Zaan runs for her shield (coming up later).\n\n|cffff00Laser|r - The laser will move around the room all of the time. This just like the ice and the geyser must be avoided. When caught in it you will turn to stone. Now this one DOES re-spawn unlike the two above but you want to avoid this at all costs UNTIL later.\n\n|cffff00Dawnbreaker/heavy attack|r - The boss Dawnbreaker/heavy attack the person with agro (should be the tank) This will not only hit with direct damage but ALSO hit in a small aoe too. If you are not a tank, do NOT stand in this, and if you are, make sure you are BLOCKING and not running away. It is delayed animation wise and it WILL catch you.\n\n|cffff00Fire breath|r - The boss will pick a target and aim at them with a constant recasting wave of flames like a breath. Each HIT must be avoided. I have seen many people run around and panic while killing the rest of the group. THIS is a very important reason first of all for the straight line formation. If the flames are on you, take a WIDE circle (run) to the left. Quite literally move in ONE large circle from the group, to your left, and back to your group again. THIS will allow it to be OFF the group, it WONT catch you and by the time the last tick hits you will be back in your original position.\n\nIf you are caught out with this one however and the above tactic is not an option, simple stay back as far as possible and weave in and out of the flames until they are gone.\n\n|cffff00Flame Beam|r - The will select ONE player and hold them in the air draining their health rapidly with a flaming beam! This looks exactly the same as the Zaan monster helmet effect. If someone is caught in this they will continuously take damage until the effect is over or they die. When this happens, someone must get IN the way of the beam and block to take some of the damage. The tank can literally just stand in it and block, BUT if the tank is the target, then the dps, healer may want to quickly take 1 dodge roll through it just to take the edge off for a quick tick. No longer than a split second as a squishy though because you will die.\n\n|cffff00Ice Statues|r - Every time the boss reaches a 20% checkpoint (she will finish her current mechanic so you can over burn) at 80% 60% 40% AND 20% she will be invulnerable and spawn 3 ice statues in the room. Keep an eye on the floor to see the ice trail aiming to where she is summoning them from. This is 'focus or die'. Basically all 3 statues MUST be killed as fast as possible. While they are alive the group will take HUGE ice damage over time. This is where the healer must focus on as much heal over time to counter the huge damage over time. Spamming breath of life will leave someone dead. Focus on what you are doing here and protect the group. Also as a healer if you have barrier, this can help.\n\nOnce the ice statues are down zaan will drop her shield, all 3 dragon statues will breath poison and coat the ENTIRE room! You have VERY limited time to react and this goes into the next mechanic below!\n\n|cffff00Save yourselves!!|r - The 3 mechanics above i have mentioned to avoid? The laser beam, the geyser and the ice on the ground? Well technically there are now x4! The shield Zaan dropped is the remaining 4th mechanic.\n\nAs soon as the ice phase is over and all adds are dead, to survive the poison you must ALL be protected.\n\nOn the regular normal/vet mode everyone can just hug Zaan's shield and be safe...but NOT here!\nEvery player must be assigned a mechanic. So, have one person stand in ice, one person stand in laser beam, one person stand in the geyser and one person stand in Zaan's shield and take the synergy!\n\nIf each person successfully got into a mechanic on their own, in time for the poison to fire, everyone will survive. If one person fails, or if the mechanics were taken BEFORE this phase and they have no where to go. They are dead. One shot!\n\n|cffff00My Shield!|r  - The boss scream 'MY SHIELD', when this happens NO ONE must be standing in her shield. She will run to it to protect herself and pick it back up off the floor. After she has it back the fight repeats itself (with a twist explained below). She must be put with the adds and stacked while the group burn down the adds in their original 'straight line' formation. Rinse repeat this process EVERY 20%. Basically it is the same fight over and over and over until she is dead, but now we have poison in the room after the first successful shield phase.\n\n|cffff00Poison Breath|r  - If you have successfully survived the first phase of ice, stuns, poison, shield etc etc. You will or SHOULD be back in your formation killing adds and watching for mechanics...BUT, Now the statues are awake!This is the main reason above all for the straight line. One dragon statue at random every few seconds will create a large triangle breath aoe on the ground and ANYONE caught in it is dead. Blocking or dodge rolling makes no difference you are dead.\n\nHence the straight line. The line is to be between one of TWO possible poison locations. As soon as you see it, either step right, or step left, TOGETHER. Doing this will make sure that you stay in formation, everything is controlled and you don't take one shots. If anyone decides they think they know better and starts running around the room or going too far out of formation, they run a MASSIVE risk of dying.\n\nFocus and stay in formation.\n\nSO, key points.\nKill adds with ultimates, don't pick up aoes and stay in a straight line.\nEvery 20% health , kill 3 statues, get IN your assigned aoes and survive the aoe poison.\nWhen Zaan goes to get her shield get ready to get back into position (straight line) to drop ultimates on the adds and rinse repeat.\nStraight line is key for the poison and the flame breath so focus.\n\nBest of luck to you all and have fun!!\n\n"

The tank should hold onto the boss at the BOTTOM of the stairs and face her towards them. Don't physically have her standing on the stairs because that can sometimes get her stuck and result in some messy situations when mechanics kick in. The group should stand behind her (dps and healers) in a triangle formation ready for her attacks. You must be all in your own space to be able to determine WHO the next target will be, some of her mechanics she will single out an individual player and you NEED to see who it is. The tank must NOT drop taunt, else things can go horrible wrong.\n\n|cffff00Zombies|r - During the fight there will be zombies running at the group, the longer the fight the more zombies you will get. Basic low-mid aoe damage will dispose of these as they are quite weak but you will want to be sure to kill them else mechanics can get on top of you. Do not run away they are very fast and will just kill you in the back of the head anyway. Stand your ground, keep your dots down and kill them.\n\n|cffff00Flame Waves|r - The boss will face a random member of the group and force waves of fire at them(3x waves) in area of affect. This can hit anyone caught in the cone. Each wave does huge damage and knock back and if you are caught by 2-3 of them you are most likely dead. The trick to this is formation, so long as you are srpead out, you can see who the target is. When she spins around to fire at a member of the group, everyone should move to the SIDES of her, doing this will result in her completely missing. So hug up at her sides, and when she has finished and goes back to hitting the tank. Resume position as normal.\n\n|cffff00Fire Towers|r - During the fight the towers to the left and the right of the boss will throw fire into the room and onto the floor. Be sure to NOT stand in these negative aoe effects as they will do rapid damage over time and kill you quickly. The longer the fight goes on the more fire will spread in the room.\n\n|cffff00Prisoner!|r - During the fight the boss will pick a random player and throw them into one of the four cages full of fire. During this moment you have two choices, pick/break the lock or get someone else to do it for you. This is where your legerdemain skills will come in handy. If you are capable of breaking out be sure to put on a ticking heal or a damage shield on (or have the healer focus you) while you get out. Failing that stay alive as long as possible and be sure you have an assigned lock breaker in your group to come get you out asap!\n\n"

They all have a different role, have relatively low health per target but have some serious damage output. So the tank needs to be in control at all times if possible and the healer really has to be on point. The trick is that these can be CC'd (chained, rooted, stunned). So get your tank to taunt all 3 of them and stack them up. Watch your FEET! You should focus the tank first, then the dps, and THEN  the healer (in order of kill). The healer is the easiest to manage since you can just keep it interrupted thought out the fight (to prevent healing) while dealing with the other two.\n\n|cffff00Micella Carlinus|r - This boss is the tank boss. Sword and board and all the usual stuns and debuffs. This is your primary focus as a dps. Be sure to kill this boss first else it gets really tricky. She has stuns, and a nasty Dragonknight banner and can also cast engulfing flames causing the other two to do more damage to you. This buffer/debuffer MUST die first. So stack all three enemies together but focus this one down.\n\n|cffff00Cordius Pontifio|r - The boss is the dps type. Typically moves like a Nightblade, dual wield and teleport strikes etc but has Dragonknight abilities too. He also can drop a banner and has a habit of hitting the odd steel tornado too so be careful. He also has a banner which MUST be avoided!\n\n|cffff00Otho Numida|r - The boss is the healer type and is the last one you should have alive. During the fight heals will be distributed to the tank and dps types and all you have to do is interrupt to stop it. Repeat this every time a heal comes out until the tank and the dps bosses are dead and then finish this one off. Be careful however as this boss DOES have a Dragonknight Banner. Also this boss has a flame staff firing out light attacks and uses an ability that i like to call 'The wheel' mechanic (exactly the same as the first boss in banished cells II) where the boss will stand on the spot and cast constant fire spokes in a circle on the floor. Stay in the gaps and don't get caught out. 1-2 of these fire attacks will kill you as they hit VERY hard, especially when a banner is down.\n\n"

This boss is the bane of most player's dungeon runs. MOSTLY because of lack of co-ordination! The ONLY way to taught/get agro from this boss is to pick up the pinion. Yes a piece armour is still required for the debuff to resistance but NO taunting 'skill' in the game will get her attention, you MUST have the pinion in your possession to make her come to you. This is going to take some practice, but the tank should start with the pinion and hold the boss as still as possible while the group surround her in a circle. Do NOT stand stacked because you will kill each other with stacking aoes. The person whom currently has the pinion will take CONSTANT fire damage which will get stronger and stronger the longer they hold on to it, so the healer must focus.\n\n|cffff00Flame bursts|r - Each player and some random locations will be affected by a SMALL fire aoe that spreads very fast and explodes. You must stay out of these as much as possible. Simply move to the side/front/back of it and let it pass, then get back into position. If you stack together, multiples will appear in the same place(since they are carried by the players) and you will blow your group up.\n\n|cffff00Portals|r - You are taught this mechanic earlier in the dungeon, but you are looking for a dark aura on your head and above all, the WHOLE screen will go grey scale and all colours will be washed out. THIS means YOU have portal duty. Two people at once will have the affect and you must look around the room for portals and destroy them before adds come through. The portals are weak and can be killed fast but ONLY the people with grey screens/aura can attack them. If you do not kill them you will get completely overwhelmed with adds and make this fight 10 times more difficult. Once the portals are gone you can carry on as normal. Note: the person with the pinion will never get portals so long as the pinion is in their possession. This is very important since you do not want the tank to get it (generally they have low damage and struggle to kill portals).\n\n|cffff00Dive|r - The boss will dive into the ground and pop back up again, doing a MASSIVE aoe, burst. This must be avoided. Simply dodge roll or walk out of it. If you fail you will take a knock back and high flame damage.\n\n|cffff00Piggy In The Middle!|r - This is the mechanic that kills everyone! The above 'dive' mechanic will happen TWICE! The second one, she will appear engulfed in BLUE flames. If you go near her she will snare you to almost a stand still and if her flames touch you, you are dead! Even a full health tank with 50k hps can die in just 2-3 ticks of damage. THIS is where you play piggy in the middle.\n\nBe sure that the tank runs to the furthest corner/side of the room and lure her over. As she is on the move Portals will appear. Once those portals have appeared (of course deal with the portals) be sure that someone else takes the pinion and runs to the OPPOSITE side of the room. This will take her attention OFF the tank luring her on a long run across the room. During this phase the new pinion holder will start to take flame damage overtime and the tank will still need heals for the remaining HIGHLY aggressive dot still on them. When the boss is about 10meters or so away from the player she is chasing, the tank should take BACK the pinion and run away again to the opposite side/corner of the room. You are literally playing piggy in the middle right now! Don;t let her TOUCH ANYONE! you MUST keep her moving back and forth. Once she gets half way across the room chasing back to the tank once the pinion is taken( if done efficiently) she will be about half way across the room. She will dive into the floor, with an aoe burst and be stunned for a few seconds. While she is in this state this is the group's opportunity to reposition around her and continue just as if it was the start of the fight repeating all of the above.\n\nThis will be a rinse repeat process for the rest of the fight REGARDLESS of how much damage your group does or does not have. The ONLY thing that gets worse when the boss is low health is you will get MORE portals. Apart from that, keep doing what you are doing. Remember every SECOND ground dive, she will turn blue and you need to resort to piggy in the middle. Good luck!!\n\n"

There are some rather unforgiving moments in this fight where things can go horribly wrong and it becomes increasingly difficult to recover. When you enter the room you will see Kena in the middle of the room being shielded by 4x adds. She will jump and smash the wall around the room exposing fire in a huge ring. do NOT go anywhere near it. I don't need to be the one to tell you that fire 'burns' but it does! The adds are very important. They shield her, so yes you guessed it, if you kill them, the shield goes away. This will be important during two phases of the fight BUT you must be very clear about their mechanics. Yes killing them WILL take away her shield but they also explode when they die. If you are standing in the aoe when they blow up, you WILL die...tank or not, it is a guaranteed one shot kill mechanic! The tank needs to focus here and despite her constant want to run around the room, must control her and hold her as dead center of the room as possible at all costs. If kena goes loose, you are all going to end up being pushed into the fire!\n\n|cffff00Wind|r - Kena will occasionally cast a rather large thin angled cone affect in front of her, walk/dodge out of this so you are not thrown across the room. The damage isn't very high but this does make YOU move from the middle of the room and/or wherever you are and she will streak straight to you afterwards, making it difficult to reposition her. She has lightning damage for sure but she is a melee type target engagement wise. She LIKES to be close. Take advantage of that and be careful not to let her push you around. This aoe is somewhat inaccurate also, so be sure you are DEFINITELY out of the aoe by at least a few extra feet. You can sometimes block this and not be thrown and/or use an immovable pot.\n\n|cffff00Lightning call|r - The boss will channel lightning from the sky and place 4x small moving aoe type lightning affects on the ground. These zig zag about a bit and should be avoided, simply watch your feet, don't panic and you will be fine. If they hit you they will do moderate lightning damage.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Spin!|r - This is where kena will call a long strip of spinning lightning across the center of the room. This moves around in the direction of her choice. If you are caught by this you will take MASSIVE lightning damage AND you will have a damage overtime effect stuck to you causing high damage afterwards. The trick to this is NOT to run around like crazy but to simply stay as close to the middle as possible while following it round. If you are on the outside of the room you will have to run fast to avoid it, if you are in the middle it is much easier to maneuver with it. The tank should hold the boss still while moving around her and everyone else should try to stay behind her while moving with the spin. You can dodgeroll THROUGH the lightning if you are capable or have no choice, but i would not recommend doing it on purpose at this stage.\n\nNOTE: Hard mode, this lightning move at almost double the speed so hug that middle section and follow it without fail!\n\n|cffff00Storm Atronach|r - The boss will occasionally call down a stunning aoe into the ground and from it will spawn a Storm Atronach. When this spawns you must focus it as soon as possible! If you do not kill it, it will chase down a member of the group at random. If it TOUCHES them, the boss will stun them and explode causing a guaranteed one shot death to anyone caught in the aoe. do NOT let it touch you if YOU are the target. Kill it fast!\n\n|cffff00Shield Phase!|r - At around mid Health point 50-60% health depending on your group's damage (some can push way lower than this but it is triggered by health regardless, she maybe mid mechanics before firing it.) She will go into the center and reset the original scenario you saw when you entered. There will be 4x adds around the room and they all must be killed to drop her shield again. Each add remember when they explode, will kill a player in one shot if they are in the aoe so stay away from their feet.\n\nKena will JUMP in the air and push everyone backwards a REALLY long way so when she rises up you MUST hug the middle of the room so you are not thrown into the fire. When she lands she will raise her hands and cast two waves of lightning which cause massive damage. If you or your tank has damage shields available for the group or a nova is present (whatever mitigates damage) you will need to take advantage of these, plus any heals you may have. The shock waves are easier to manage if you stay at long range from her. You can get in the gaps and be safe, BUT if you DO get caught, be sure to block. It will mitigate a lot of the damage but not the small knock back. If you do get hit and you are blocking and survive, be sure to heal up QUICKLY, even if you have a damage shield on. Having the lightning touch you will trigger an extremely aggressive damage over time on you which in a couple of seconds can strip your health bar. This will repeat...JUMP, then lightning waves twice (two casts of two waves) and then jump again..over and over and over until you kill all of the adds. Be careful. The longer this lasts the further you will be thrown back per jump phase.\n\nSo, to simplify, when she jumps, stay close, when she does lightning, get range. Once the adds are dead the shield will be removed and you can attack her like normal. The fight continues as normal with all mechanics in place.\n\nAt 25-30% depending on overlapping mechanics and/or dps of your group, she will go into the shield again for a second time. Repeat the above process to release her again.\n\n|cffff00EXECUTE!|r - After the second shield phase is over she goes into the final stage! She will have ALL of the above mechanics at once BUT, she will cast the spinning lightning wall x2! That's right, TWO spinning lightning walls at once, spinning different directions! Do not panic! Keep her as central as possible as before and stick to your mechanics. stay close to the middle as a group and when the 2 lines are about to close in on you, dodge roll THROUGH the lightning. Continue this process until she is dead!\n\nBest of luck!!\n\n"

The group should always remain BEHIND the boss or the will be hit with nasty area of affect abilities. This can be a fairly mobile fight so the tank has to pay close attention to potential repositioning of the boss throughout!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - As simple as it sounds, this heavy attack will knockdown and do HIGH physical damage. The tank needs to be sure to BLOCK this attack. If a dps or healer is hit with this they should try to dodge roll on time to avoid it, or block it and hope they don't take a one shot. This should generally ALWAYS be on the tank. So be sure your taunt does not fall off!\n\n|cffff00Dawnbreaker|r - The boss will cast a frontal aoe Dawnbreaker attack, very similar to the player version of it. This will do HUGE damage and apply a knock down. The tank should block this or simply stand out of it but the group(dps and healer) should NOT get hit with this. It can potentially one shot anyone who is not a tank or is unprepared for it. Since this is of course frontal aoe, it stands to reason that the tank must ALWAYS keep the boss turned AWAY from the group!\n\n|cffff00ADDS|r - There will be adds spawning in the fight. The first waves spawns with the boss, the second spawns at 75% of the boss's health, and the 3rd at 40%.\n\nThe adds are all different to each other, you will have dual wield types, casters, healers and two handers. These are small adds and easy to kill if they are controlled so the tank should bring them in to where the boss is and cc them in position while the group kill them with aoe (or focus them individually, depends on the group setup and dps output). The healers need to be interrupted to prevent healing and the two handers MUST be blocked if they heavy attack anyone. They hit very hard and can one shot an unsuspecting player!  They also need to be interrupted if they start charging up a circular aoe around them. The burst if it succeeds will do HIGH damage.\n\nIn the last pack you must be extra careful, there is an add with a sword and shield with a flag on his back. THIS MUST be FOCUSED. He has nasty breath aoe attacks and very large hard hitting heavy attacks. The tank needs to grab this asap and the group should prioritize the target at all costs.\n\n|cffff00Circle Of Protection|r - The boss will occasionally cast a Circle Of Protection on the floor. It is CRUCIAL that the tank notices this. The circle will buff the boss with resistances and rapidly heal the boss while standing in it, as well as ANY adds. You MUST as the tank, keep the boss OUT of this circle at all times otherwise it is going it be an extremely long fight!\n\nSIMPLE NOTES: Keep the boss still, turned away from the group. Pull adds in to where the boss is and focus adds until they are down.  Every time you see a circle of protection, reposition the boss.\n\n"

One is ranged and one is melee, so the tank must understand how to manipulate ranged vs agro. Ranged targets will only ever come TO the tank if the ranged target cannot reach them (it will chase until in range). Melee however will always follow very close. SO the trick to this fight is to taunt BOTH bosses, BUT, put the Melee boss as close as possible to the Ranged one. Not the other way around (good tanks know this, new tanks will need practice). Keep them as close as possible to each other and at all costs, keep them faced AWAY from the group.\n\nThe dps/healer players should always stay on the enemies back, not the front! Focus the mage down FIRST she is your main priority!\n\n|cffff00Bonfire|r - It is essential that you follow the base mechanics of the arena while on this fight. If you have gotten this far you have already re-lit the bonfire at least twice. If this boss fight goes on for too long the fire WILL go out and you will have to light it again, pay attention to this mechanic else everyone will freeze to death.\n\n|cffff00ADDS|r - There are many adds in this fight at around 50% of the combined boss's health bar and again at around 26%, and the tank will have a hard time controlling them all. So people need to first of all not panic! Don't run around like a headless chicken, dodge and block as and when required and stay focused.\n\nThe adds will need to be taken care of so have plenty of aoe down on the ground to help deal with them and focus individuals based on importance and danger of the enemy you are facing.\n\nArchers are your number 1 priority. The tank needs to chain these in and pin them asap and they must be killed, they have huge damage and can be a real problem if left alive too long.\n\nTrolls are easy to deal with simply hold them still as a tank and everyone else stay out of their face.\n\nMelee enemies and casters are general trash so not too bad but the one with the flag on his back MUST be focused. If he heavy attacks players they will die unless they block. So be careful and keep your eyes open!\n\n|cffff00Katti Ice-Turner (Destruction Staff skills)|r\n\n|cffff00Ice Root|r - She will cast a channeled ability, normally at the tank or whoever has aggro, which needs to be interrupted. If not interrupted she will cast a ground projected aoe and the player affected will take HIGH single hit damage and be rooted in ice. You will have to dodge roll out of this or wait for it to expire. As dps/healers you do NOT want to be hit by this so keep eyes on her at all times and be ready to interrupt her!\n\n|cffff00Ice Wall|r - Katti will occasionally cast an ice wall of elements on the ground, this can do high damage over time and also slow you down/immobilize you. This is presented with a large strip type aoe on the ground (much like a charge ability) and should be avoided.\n\n|cffff00Storm|r - At low health she will cast a large circular aoe around her dealing high ice damage over time, simply stay out of this until it is over or until she is dead.\n\n|cffff00Yavni Frost-skin (Two Hander Skills)|r\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack/uppercut|r - This boss is very simple, he hits HARD and has a lot of basic attacks. The main one to avoid is his heavy attack. he will try to uppercut whoever has aggro (should be the tank) This MUST be blocked else you will be thrown into the air and backwards!\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - As well as basic attacks he will cleave occasionally. This is a fast paced frontal aoe attack. This doesn't cause TOO much of a problem damage wise but dps and healers should avoid it if possible. Simply stay out of the bosses face!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 ARENA THREE: NAK'TAH & SHILIA |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis arena is a pain but as described and demonstrated in the video there are of course ways to co-ordinate with your group to make this very simple and almost fool proof when it comes to the poison. The boss however can get a little tricky especially since one of them is ranged and likes to run around and teleport. So the tank and the group must NOT panic and must focus on controlling themselves and the enemy. You can tank them where they spawn but that is VERY risky for when the poison comes up and most will die to it so below if you don't favor the stacking on the spawn point i will explain a safer positioning.\n\nThe tank should try to taunt both bosses and run towards the east spawn area. This will put the ranged boss on the corner. Once the boss is there, walk back IN again and hold it there while stacking the melee on top of it. This corner is SAFE from all large poison bursts in the room (so no poison one shots!).\n\nThe group should focus down the Mage/caster boss FIRST. The melee is very easy to position, the mage is tricky.\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - The 4 corners of the room have stranglers and during the fight they will pull people across the room to their position. If you are pulled during a poison burst and you go THROUGH the poison in transit, you will die. SO, it is a lot easier if a dps goes around and kills these stranglers as and when they appear. They don't have a lot of health so shouldn't be too difficult to dispatch. Leaving them alive however can be a mess, so be careful, and remember the lines between the corners to avoid the poison. There are safe spots as explained in the video!\n\n|cffff00ADDS!|r - At around 53% there will be adds spawning in the room. These can get tricky so be sure you have plenty of AOE down on the ground. They don't have a lot of health but they can overwhelm you if you are not careful.\n\nThe wizards need to be chained in and interrupted while they are alive else they will put massive aoes on the floor and your group will have a hard time surviving.\n\nNerids need to be focused asap! They are your priority targets!\n\n|cffff00Wamasu|r - The wamasu will spawn at between 40-45% health of the boss's combined hp. You MUST focus this down. The tank should bring it into the group and turn it away. All dps/healers should stay behind it at all times. It has a frontal aoe and nasty shock damage attacks so kill this as soon as possible regardless of the other enemies in the room. If this stays alive for too long you will have problems.\n\n|cffff00Nak'Tah (Storm Calling Skills)|r\n\n|cffff00Streak|r - This boss is slippery, SOMETIMES, this boss likes to be in the face of people, and will streak away OR streak into melee range. So once positioned, running away is a pain, but when NOT positioned, it can sometimes land where you want it. However, if this happens, the group MUST stand behind it. A BIG attack is coming and only the tank should try to stand in it...\n\n|cffff00Overload!|r - As you may have guessed this boss is a sorcerer, and it has sorcerer abilities. IF the boss gets close it will decide sometimes to cast Overload! It will emit a HUGE widespread cone channeling high lightning damage while the effect is active. The tank can stand and block this, all dps/healers should stay OUT of this or pretty much die.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Form|r - Just like the sorcerer class, this boss can go into a lightning form. Resistance is up and also standing TOO close will make you take shock damage each second. You can still reach with melee while standing outside of this aoe as it is quite small, but you do not want to stand inside of it for long periods of time.\n\n|cffff00Liquid Lightning|r - The boss will cast a mid sized circular aoe on the ground which does lightning damage over time, do NOT stand in this.\n\n|cffff00Shilia (Duel Wield Skills)|r\n\n|cffff00Cripple|r - This boss will cast/channel for a couple of seconds and requires an interrupt. failure to interrupt will cripple a player stunning them to the ground (they will have to break free) and applying a bleed damage over time to them. Interrupt this mechanic and it wont be a problem!\n\n|cffff00Spin to win!|r - The boss will occasionally cast steel tornado (spin hitting all targets in aoe). While it looks dangerous, he really doesn't hit that hard. you can block it, or heal through it.\n\nSIMPLE NOTES: Stay together, hold both bosses together, interrupt when required, focus adds especially the wamasu, and if required send someone out to kill the stranglers. Tank holds stuff turned away, dps hits stuff in the back. Hug the corner so you don't get poison aoe'd to death (safe spot).\n\n"

It purely depends on your group's ability to understand the mechanics and coordinate. The tank should of course taunt and hold the boss as still as possible at all times while turning the boss away from the group, BUT this is a fairly mobile fight if you want to be safe and efficient. So the tank will have to reposition the boss occasionally depending on what is happening in the room. Relax and focus, and don't drop the boss!\n\n|cffff00House Dres Enslaver|r  - These are KEY! They will put a white beam on a player of their choice. The beam will do HIGH damage over time so healing will be required. After the beam has finished it will pop and an Enslaver Shadow will appear at the feet of the player affected.\n\nThe trick to this is control. IF you are a player that has a beam on them, run ot the edge of the map (wall corner whatever) and wait out the beam. Once it is finished, dodge roll and get back to the group. THIS deliberately PLACES the shadows around the edges keeping them OFF the group.\n\nEach House Dres Enslaver should be killed. This is where the tank comes in. If the tank simply stacks the boss on them. They can be killed with AOE. failing that, if it is not convenient, kill the add, then go back to the boss. This will be fairly fast paced though so you must pay attention.\n\nNOTE: The Enslaver drops a Shadow after the beam finishes (placement is key) but if you KILL it before the beam is over, it will drop it where you are, and that COULD be in the group. CAREFUL!\n\n|cffff00Enslaver Shadow|r  - These are what spawn from the beams. They spin a sword around violently on repeat in a circular aoe. If you are caught in this you can die in as little as two ticks of damage. So when you drop these off at the sides you MUST get out of their way fast, do NOT stand in the aoe, and if these get dropped in the group, stay away!\n\nDo not bother trying to kill these, they have high health and you will get overwhelmed by the time you have killed them. So simply, drop them off at the edges and ignore them. Watch your feet.\n\n|cffff00ADDS|r  - These spawn at around 70% and 30%, they are minor annoyances. A mage and a kwama type each time. They generally die pretty fast to aoe damage but be sure to kill them as soon as you see them so they don't cause too many complications.\n\n|cffff00Fossilize|r  - The boss of course is a Dragonknight and has Dragonknight abilities from the earthen heart skill line. One of which is fossilize. The boss will pick one random target and incase them in stone. This can be dodge rolled, but if caught, simply break free.\n\n|cffff00Eruption|r  - The boss will cast a small circular aoe on the ground which will do flame damage over time for a short time. Unlike the player variation of it, this does NOT last 18 seconds. It is fairly fast. Simply stay out of it.\n\n|cffff00Igneous shield|r  - The boss will occasionally put on a damage shield, simply keep damaging the boss to break it, or wait until it has run out. Nothing stressful here really.\n\n|cffff00BASH|r  - The boss will attack with a massive spinning bash at the tank (or whoever has agro, should be the tank ) Simply block this attack. If you fail you will be knocked down and take high damage. Also getting knocked back here is very risky based on all of the aoe in the room you could be thrown into. So be sure to NOT miss the block!\n\nSIMPLE NOTES: Tank stacks the boss on the Enslavers. Enslaver beamed players should move to the edges and drop off shadows (do not bother killing shadows). Priority is Enslaver kill first, boss kill second.\n\n"

The tank should hold the boss where he spawns, turn it away from the group and the group should stay behind the boss at all times and watch for aoes.\n\n|cffff00Shadowcasters|r - There are TWO of these in the fight. And this is why the tank will need to reposition the boss. The first one is upon the start of the fight. So keep the boss still and focus this down while doing aoe to the boss at the same time. The shadow caster must be killed asap as explained and demonstrated in the video. If you don't kill it in time and people get cursed...you must ALL individually find one glowing plate and stand on it to cleanse before you explode and die.\n\nThe second shadow cast appears on the west door of the arena at around 40% health of the boss and must also be focused. So simple kill the first one, and then move the boss to the other door for the rest of the fight.\n\n|cffff00ADDS!|r - The adds will spawn at health percentages of the boss's health. The first wave is at 100% (shadowcaster and a gargoyle) remember as a tank you MUST turn the gargoyles away from the group and block their heavy attacks. Also the gargoyle will slam the ground, when this happens, get out of the aoe until it is over and then come back in again. Pretty easy to see.\n\nThe second wave is at around 78%, there will be an assassin, a two hander, a scorpion and a gargoyle. Simply stack these on the boss and kill them with aoe. Just be careful again to not get heavy attacked or stand in front of the gargoyle as a dps/healer, and watch for the two hander heavy attacking the group.\n\nThe third add wave is actually a close by piromancer. While a lone add, this can hit incredibly hard. The tank needs to chain this in asap! If it gets a chance to channel,, you must interrupt it. If you fail, he will cast a straight line of flames across the floor and depending on resists and such can actually hit a dps with a one shot. So careful!\n\n|cffff00BANNER!|r - The boss will drop a Dragonknight standard on the ground. inside this you will take MASSIVE flame damage over time, at all costs, do NOT stand in this!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is very straight forward. The boss will uppercut the tank (or whoever has aggro). Be sure to block this or you will get knocked back and take HIGH damage.\n\n|cffff00Aura/Volatile Armour|r - The boss has a buff which surrounds him in a negative aura/aoe. Be sure to not touch this for prolonged periods od time. It does HIGH damage over time and will kill a dps/healer quickly. So while doing damage watch your distance. Melee can still reach from outside of it.\n\n|cffff00Breath|r - The boss is obviously a Dragonknight and has all that comes with it, he can breath fire! This is a cone area of effect attack and all players caught in it will take damage over time flame damage. Be sure to keep the heals coming in case this happens, but generally if you are not in the boss's face you should be fine.\n\nSIMPLE NOTES: Tank the boss on the spot and kill the Shadowcaster and adds at the beginning. Once the shadow caster is down take the boss to the west door (or before 40% health) and kill the other shadow caster. KILL the boss while dealing with adds and stay out of the aoe. very simple fight for the most part.\n\n"

The tank should hold the boss where she spawns and the group should be in a formation that gives plenty of space. Everyone needs their OWN place to stand in far away from everyone else ( a solid triangle formation for the healer and dps). If you are stacked you CANNOT tell who she is going to attack, spread out! It doesn't matter if you are melee or ranged, what DOES matter is that you do not stack. This is clearly demonstrated in the video. Formation is key.\n\n|cffff00Draining shot!|r - This is the primary reason you MUST stay out of your group member's faces. If you are in a triangluar formation, (dps and healers) you can CLEARLY see which person she is aiming at. She will pick a target at random and wind up a long channeled shot. If you are the player targeted, you must do a well timed dodge roll to avoid it. Failure to avoid it will do MASSIVE damage and completely drain your resources. If you stack, it is impossible to see who has this on them and people WILL die! Formation, focus, see the mechanic and react!. Do NOT run away, if this series should have taught you anything by now it is that in THIS game, running does NOT save you.\n\n|cffff00Arrow Spray|r - This is a very simple long ranged cone aoe attack. If you see the telegraph for this simply step to one side to avoid it. Like many archers in the game this ability can be avoided with little effort but if caught in it you will take HIGH damage over time.\n\n|cffff00ADDS|r - Adds will spawn at health percentages starting with the original spawn at 100%, the second wave is at around the 70% mark, and wave 3 is at 40%.\n\nThese adds are enemies you have seen already but you will be facing archers, werewolves, lurchers and sprigains. Each one should be brought into the gorup and will for the most part die with aoe, but you should primary the lurcher since he is the roughest of the bunch. Be warned however, do NOT dnace around the room. If you do not position these well, they will be spread out and this is when things get messy. Spread out kills are bad! The enemies drop a green circle on the floor, these circles replenish stamina per tick but also do MASSIVE damage. If they are all over the room they are hard to avoid. If they are all in one place they are easier to avoid. So control the adds and watch your feet, remember though, at all times keep eyes on the boss and keep your formation!\n\nSIMPLE NOTES: keep the boss in the middle, have a clean formation. Dodge roll if you have a shot aimed at you and kill the adds close to the boss controlled. DO NOT run around like a |cffff00headless chicken.|r\n\n"

This is all about group coordination and understanding of basic mechanics. The Tank should try to stack the knight on the mage at all times and keep a REALLY close eye on what they are doing. This fight requires a LOT of interrupts! Do NOT drop taunt!\n\n|cffff00Sacrifices|r - You have seen these already in this arena but now it is even MORE important to pay attention to them. North , west and east areas will have sacrifices appearing (two regular and one armored one). These MUST be primaried asap. If they are not killed before they get to the shrines, they will summon huge Daedra and you will have to fight them as well as the bosses. We are talking spider Daedra, Daedroths and all manner of nastiness. Kill the sacrifices!\n\nThe first sacrifices will spawn at the beginning of the fight, so focus them asap. The next waves will be at 70%, 50%, and again at between 15-18% health of the total boss health bar.\n\n|cffff00ADDS|r - You will get adds in the room at health percentages of the full boss health bar during the fight. Around the 70% health area you will get a Daedroth. he must be dealt with asap because he has some NASTY knock backs, stuns, and breath attacks. He should be brought into the fight with the bosses, turned away from the group and killed asap.\n\nAlso at 25%you will get a Clanfear and 2 Dremora in the room (one caster one sword and board) their attacks are nasty so if they heavy attack/cast/jump at you, you must block. The tank should pull these into the boss fight. At this stage they should be fairly easy to dispatch with aoe BUT if you are struggling, focus them down and get them out of the way fast.\n\n|cffff00Dark Mage (Dark Magic Skills)|r\n\n|cffff00Negate bubble|r - The boss has a negate bubble and it is NOT friendly! Stay OUT of this at all costs. It will stun people, negate magic users from using their abilities, do damage over time and basically wipe the group if you stay in it.\n\nBe sure to save your ultimates until AFTER this has gone else your ultimates will be negated/removed.\n\n|cffff00Crystal Shard|r - The boss will channel a hard cast Crystal shard! This hits incredibly hard, knocks down, and can borderline one shot a dps/healer. This is focused on a random target and MUST be interrupted!\n\n|cffff00Daedric Mines|r - The boss will surround herself in Daedric Mines. If you stand in them they will explode, and stun you. Try not to stand in them. BUT, if a tank has mist form on, they can run around the boss in one swift circle and make them all pop (removing the problem).\n\n|cffff00Magic Bomb|r - The boss will channel an ability with her staff in the air and when finished will cast a massive magicka damage based bomb that will land on the ground and explode in large area of effect. This MUST be interrupted!\n\n|cffff00Burst/Explosion|r - The boss will levitate and channel up an ability which if successful will burst in aoe damage. This MUST be interrupted!\n\n|cffff00Shadow Knight (Dawn's wrath skills)|r\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is a very simple visual, a heavy attack will be wound up at the tank (or whoever has agro) simply block this to prevent huge damage and knock back.\n\n|cffff00NOVA!|r - This must be avoided at all costs! Not only does the dark mage have a negate bubble but this guy has a Nova! If he places this, get OUT of it as soon as possible, it does MASSIVE damage.\n\n|cffff00Vampire's bane/Reflected Light|r - The boss will cast a single target damage over time on players which will do high damage. This needs to be healed through or purified/cleansed.\n\n|cffff00Purifying light|r - The boss will cast purifying light on a player stacking up damage over time to pop in a burst of damage after 6 seconds, just like the Templar ability players have. Once it has popped it will leave a heal on the ground for the boss to heal with. Keep him away from whatever target has this effect on them if possible so he doesn't heal.\n\n|cffff00Dark Flare|r - The boss will channel and cast a single target shot at a player of his choice. Interrupt this to avoid it from happening.\n\nSIMPLE NOTES: Always primary the sacrifices as soon as they are spawned. Focus the Mage and make sure you interrupt EVERYTHING! After the mage is dead, focus down the Knight while avoiding nova and killing adds. The fight is a lot easier once the mage is dead!\n\n"

However over-nuking or lack of care and attention can result in a very fast WIPE. The tank needs to taunt and hold the boss still at all times and the group needs to spread out and find their OWN space.\n\n|cffff00Ice Comet/Meteor|r - The boss will pick a random target and fire a Meteor at them. DO NOT dodge roll, this is why you stay apart, to see who has it on them. When it is in transit you will see a circle of dots at your feet. When you see this, BLOCK! Once it lands, THEN move away from the aoe left over on the floor.\n\n|cffff00Volcanic Rune|r - The boss will cast runs on the ground. Do not stand in these. If you do, they will pop, you will be flung in the air and take HUGE flame damage.\n\n|cffff00Fire Trail|r - The boss will channel and cast a fire trail across the ground. This will wipe out a dps/healer in one shot if they stand in it, so watch your feet. However this ability CAN be interpreted, so bash/interrupt him asap to avoid this mechanic!\n\n|cffff00ADDS|r - The boss does have some basic adds. These should be focused to get them off the field, they have nasty flame and heavy attacks and you do not want to keep them alive while dealing with upcoming mechanics.\n\nTwo mages will spawn with him at 100%, a two hander will spawn at 80%. Be sure to deal with these, they are a BIG problem if they go loose.\n\n|cffff00CENTURIONS!|r - This is why you do NOT want to nuke the boss. Two waves of centurions spawn in this fight. One at 80% and one at 40%. If you try to nuke you could be overrun by too much going on at once.\n\nThe red ones will spin at random players, the yellow ones will try to cleave and the blue ones will fire shots in the air which put a curse on two players at random. THIS is where it gets tricky. That mechanic from the blue one MUST be interrupted!\n\nIf you fail to interrupt the blue Centurion, one player will get an ice aoe around them and another a fire aoe around them. These two players must stack on top of each other perfectly as fast as possible and STAY together until the aoes pop.\n\nStacked like this they will negate each other's aoe and it will disappear. If you FAIL to do this both players will blow up and die.\n\nSo, interrupt the blue Centurion and this never needs to be a problem!\n\nSIMPLE NOTES: Fight the boss till 80% and then kill the Centurions (interrupt the blue one) repeat again at 40%. The rest of the time, stay in formation, spread out and BLOCK Ice Comets. After 40% if all adds are dead, it is just 'kill him!'.\n\n"

The tank should grab the boss from her spawn point and hold her near the gate. Turn her away from the group and the rest of the group should always stay behind her while watching their feet!\n\n|cffff00Bat Swarm|r - The boss will cast a bat swarm (same as the player ultimate for vampire skill line) It has a HUGE area of affect, only lasts about 5 seconds, but if you are hit you will damage yourself and heal HER. So avoid this at all costs. The more people in the aoe, the more health she gets back.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The boss will heavy attack the tank (or whoever has aggro) to avoid this simply BLOCK it. If you do not, you will be knocked down.\n\n|cffff00ADDS|r - There are skeleton and wrath adds in this fight that must be dealt with. The tank should be sure to taunt and position them at all times and the group needs to kill them as a priority. The wrath specifically must go down fast. It has nasty ice attacks that CAN be interrupted but if not will cause one shots to the dps players and possibly the healer.\n\nThese spawn at the beginning while the boss spawns with 100% health, then again at 40% so keep your eyes open.\n\n|cffff00BANNER!|r - The vampire IS a Dragonknight and DOES drop a Dragonknight standard. If this happens, get out asap or die! It does huge damage over time and you do not want to be stuck in it.\n\n|cffff00Jumping Spin Attack|r - The boss will occasionally erupt into flames and do a massive jumping spinning attack with her shield at the tank. This can be blocked but is AOE too so others around should also block or be knocked down.\n\n|cffff00Mist Form|r - The boss will appear as though she has turned into mist/smoke. During this phase she will do aoe damage to the group and take a MASSIVE reduction to damage. Don't waste all your good stuff while she is mist form, nuke her when she comes out of it instead!\n\n|cffff00Volatile Armour|r - Very much like round 5, this boss has a buff that surrounds her with negative damage effects, try not to stand IN the aoe if you can help it. It isn't particularly large in size, but the damage output is high.\n\n|cffff00Rubyn Jonnicent & Zackael Jonnicent|r - These two are very hard hitters. The tank needs to grab them ASAP! One is a stam sorc with a two hander so will come in close and must be blocked if he heavy attacks. The other is a mag sorc and does long range crystal shards which must be interrupted or players will take one shots. They cannot be hit for more than '1' damage per attack while their ghosts exist (separate linked entity).\n\nWhen these guys are in the room, BOTH dps should jump into one of the pits (the stuff you are meant to avoid with the hands coming out). When this happens the healer and the tank will be left upstairs. The tank needs to position the new adds ready for when the dps come back to the fight, while the healer keeps him/her up.\n\nMeanwhile down stairs the two dps encounter the ghosts/spirits of the enemies plus a couple of other harder adds. You must kill these, not die and then come through the portal once they are down. The portal will put you back upstairs.\n\nNOW that the spirits are dead, the adds can be hit for full damage and MUST be focused!\n\nSIMPLE NOTES: Tank keeps the boss faced away from the groups and brings adds close with her. The group spreads out and stays out of aoe. When the Jonnicents come in, two dps go downstairs to kill ghosts, and come back up to finish the job.\n\n"

BUT there are some complicated yet simple at the same time...mechanics. This can go extremely smooth, or horrible wrong. Yes there are many cheese videos out there on how to cheat the mechanics (which lets face it usually end in tears with multiple wipes trying to get it righ...but i am here to EXPLAIN how the actual 'mechanics' are designed and work!\n\nSO, everyone go to the end of the map where he spawns. There is an open plane type area and the tank should hold him in the MIDDLE of it. while the rest of the croup make a nice semi circle behind him. Everyone needs their own space.\n\n|cffff00FLAMES!|r - At beginning of the fight the boss will hit everyone with a flame ball attack. This will emit a flame circle under each player. What you need to do here is ALL go to 4 different safe corners (split up and stand around the edges) and survive. After a few seconds the flame circle will pop, and drop on the floor, revealing a flame Atronach in EACH fire circle. The effect is no longer on you so  get BACK in the middle in order to continue the fight.\n\nNOTE: This seems to be on a timer (60-75 seconds apart) but above all just notice when it has happened and go PLACE your own aoe out of the way of the group. There are 3 major islands in this arena so use all the islands if you need to (if you get over whelmed.\n\n|cffff00Flame Atronachs|r - As noted above, each flaming aoe will spawn an Atronach. The tank should chain these IN to the fight with the main boss and the group should focus them down. They only have 500k hp each so a couple of ultimates should be more than enough of just aoe damage if you are in a high damage group. Relax, don't run away, they are really not as scary as they look!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will vanish for a second and come out of stealth with a heavy attack. This must be blocked\n\n|cffff00Deadly Cloak|r - Very similar to deadly cloak, the boss buffs himself with a whirling aoe attached to him. This deals moderate damage to anyone caught inside. Watch your feet, don't stand in it for too long or be sure to have heavy heals during it.\n\n|cffff00Soul Shred|r - Just like the Nightblade Ultimate, the boss will stun in area of effect when he jumps into the air. You will need to break free from this before he follows up with other attacks.\n\n|cffff00'LOOK a destraction!'|r - The boss sometimes jumps over the tank like a ninja fairy! He has re-positioned, don't panic, just keep a taunt up and get back into formation.\n\n|cffff00Steel Tornado|r - As well as his basic attacks he will sometimes throw out the odd steel tornado, hitting everyone within range with physical damage. Don't panic, you can block it, or heal through it.\n\n|cffff00Cripple|r - The boss will channel a cripple effect which will stun the chosen target. If this hits you simply break free, but before that you CAN interrupt it to completely avoid it.\n\nDeep Breath/Suck in mechanic|r - At 50% and 25% the boss will channel for about 3 seconds and do what is usually described as a massive 'suck in' mechanic. He will pull players in close and then straight after EXPLODE in fire. This does HUGE damage so must be blocked/mitigated. After the hit the healer needs to get people back to high health fast before he tries to finish people off with a steel tornado.\n\n|cffff00NOVA!|r - At around 40% the boss will throw down a NOVA. Get out of this asap! big damage over time and damage reduction will not help you. Reposition the boss out of the Nova and carry on as normal.\n\n|cffff00Haith's Entourage|r\n\nAt health percentages you will meet some familiar faces! Note during these spawns occasionally random Small fire mages can spawn at a distance, watch your feet, the fire across the floor hurts!\n\nChampion Marcauld & Mavus Talnarith - At 75% these two bosses you have fought before will enter the fight. Stack them together and kill them as fast as you can. The tank should stack them all together and be sure not to drop taunts. The mage will require interrupts and the sword and board will need to be turned AWAY from the group (watch for Dawnbreakers!)\n\nThe key point to these adds was demonstrated very clearly in the video...If Marcauld puts a circle of protection on the ground, the tank must move ALL enemies OUT of it. Else as you clearly saw, he doesn't just heal himself, he heals the BOSS! Marcauld (sword n board) should be your priority target, but both need to die.\n\nYavni Frost-Skin & Dark Mage - At 50% heath these two will enter the fight. Remember the Dark Mage has a negate bubble, mines and all manner of nasty interruptible abilities. She is the danger and she MUST be focused down first. Same routine as before, tank stacks everything and turns it all away while the group focuses down the adds and keeps on interrupts, but the mage MUST die.\n\nEarthen Heart Knight & Pishna Longshot - At 25% health these two bosses will span. Again the tank should stack them on the boss and turn them away from the group. Pishna should be your priority target but remember to avoid her aimed attacks! They drain resources!\n\nSIMPLE NOTE: Stack the boss and adds. Kill adds, Drop fire on the sides, come back in and continue. Rinse repeat. Keep the boss out of the circle of protection and interrupt when necessary! ;)\n\nGOOD LUCK OUT THERE!!!\n\n"

You can call these whatever you like but you MUST make sure your group can fully understand and coordinate which one is which. From the position that you first enter the room, if you are facing the main middle pad (where the boss is), i would name them as follows..'front, back, left , right, top right.' This way whatever direction is called, people know where to go. Front and back by the way are simple. Front is the furthest one away near the bridge and back is the one which will be directly behind you when you are on the middle pad if still facing the same way as when you came in.\n\nKEEP your eyes open for upcoming mechanics and make sure your direction doesn't get muddled!\n\nThe tank should hold the boss still in the middle of the room while turned away from the group at all times.\n\n|cffff00Punches|r - The boss will throw several slow punches at the tank (or whoever has agro, SHOULD be the tank!). These hit fairly hard but so long as the tank blocks them these wont be a problem. A dps can sometimes be one shot by these so do NOT drop taunt.\n\n|cffff00Storm!|r - Every few seconds (10-15seconds) the boss will raise his hands and call down an almighty storm which will do lightning damage every second, getting stronger and stronger with every tick. You MUST protect yourselves. To do this you must locate (front, back, left, right, top right) which safe zone has the LIGHT! This will be a big yellow beam (note: some players cannot see this so be fast and follow the group).\n\nIf you make it to the location fast you will be protected, and must stay in there until the storm is over. If you don't make it you are pretty much dead. You must have fast reactions for this, do NOT hang around finishing rotations!\n\nThis mechanic is the opposite of every other mechanic/rule i have mentioned in the All About Mechanics series...in THIS case, RUN LIKE HELL!\n\n|cffff00Shockwave|r - After every STORM phase, when he has finished, everyone should run back to the middle and carry on fighting him like before. However he will channel a large growing ground based lightning burst, and following that explosion will be several small fast moving ground aoes.\n\nWhen you see this effect, put on a damage shield (if you are magicka based) or BLOCK if you are stamina based. Both can block if you choose but for the most part damage shields can cover it. Stamina won't survive if they get hit with one of the small aoes if not blocking unless they have VERY high resists\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00FOUNDATION STONE ATRONACH|r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is simple but it can be messy if people don't pay attention to the mechanics. It can be a stack and burn to some extent, OR it can be a complete wipe.\n\nThe tank should taunt the main boss and turn it 90degrees so it is NOT facing the group. Note by the way the boss has an awkward hit box so highlighting the boss helps to maintain a taunt over time. The group should stack together out of the face of the boss and do what they are good at, killing it!\n\n|cffff00Ground Pound|r - The boss will occasionally pound the ground 5x and then resume basic attacks, the tank should of course block if necessary but the group are out of his face and the healers should focus heals on the group to be sure they don't die from the splash damage.\n\n|cffff00Adds!|r - During the fight adds will spawn in twos! ONE Chain Spinner and One Nullifier.\n\nThese can be dealt with in many ways but for the sake of the guide we will assume you have 2x tanks.\n\nThe main tank has the boss and should stay there. The off tank can grab the adds and stack them IN the middle on top of the boss. The Chain spinner is easy to position because he is melee, but the Nullifier will need to be manipulated position wise(ranged target. Taunt it, get OUT of it's range so it comes to you, and then come back in again. Try to position them BOTH in the middle so the group can dps them down.\n\nThe Chain Spinner has nasty stun attacks and aoe effects and the Nullifiers heal. So , focus the chain spinners first if you have to eventually focus them down, and the Nullifiers are the lowest priority. However they will require interrupting when they are trying to heal.\n\nThroughout the fight they will spawn in twos so if you do NOT kill them fast enough they will overlap and you will have multiples. So be careful.\n\nA high damage group can burn them, but a low damage group will have to lay off the boss and focus them down before revisiting the boss as a main target.\n\n|cffff00Rock Throwing!|r - At 75% health and under the boss will crouch into a ball and all around the room will be floating rocks that will be launched AT members in the group. If they hit people they will do HIGH direct damage, knock back and stun, and damage in aoe. The trick to this is very simple indeed.\n\nInstead of stacking at the boss, everyone should spread out, and hold block to avoid being knocked down. You can still cast some abilities and heals while blocking.\n\nOnce he stands up again, go back to stacking and burning. Rinse repeat this, spread out blocking tactic every time he crouches down for the rest of the fight.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00VARLARIEL|r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss as far as mechanics go are pretty simple but this can be a complete mess! This is the well known PUG KILLER of the trial. The tank should stand by the boss and taunt it, and pretty much keep her facing the tank at all times while maintaining a taunt/debuffs etc etc.\n\nThe group should be in a large circle NOT stacking, everyone must have their own space.\n\n|cffff00Magic Bolt|r - during the fight the boss will fire magical bolts at the person who has the aggro (this should be the tank). These deal moderate damage and shouldn't prove too much of a problem BUT if a dps is hit by more than one of these they will most likely die.\n\n|cffff00Split!|r - The boss will split into 3 ghosts during the fight and each one will position themselves by the pillars around the room. Once they have been killed after a time, the boss will cast a huge explosion. The more ghosts still alive the stronger the hit. If no ghosts are alive you will be completely fine!\n\nEvery explosion starts the next phase and each phase lasts 30seconds until the NEXT split. Each consecutive split will add one more ghost to the room. The maximum is 6!\n\nThere are a couple of ways to manage this especially as new groups.\n\nOne way is to have everyone assigned to a pillar. Two people per pillar EXCLUDING the reddish orange one with the mushrooms on it.\n\nThis way every phase people know where to go, they can kill their add in twos and then any remaining, people who have finished theirs can help finish off.\n\nWith the above being successful there will of course be one left on its own.\n\nHere is where your second choice comes in. Get your group collectively to nuke it since the others are dead and everyone can kill it fast. OR get back to the middle and be ready to BLOCK when the explosion happens.\n\nSo long as the boss has minor maim on it (debuff ) leaving ONE ghost alive and blocking the explosion will NOT kill your team. BUT with the debuff missing and people not blocking(or using a damage shield) they will most likely die.\n\nSo in a nut shell, 2 to a pillar, kill the ghost and come back in, OR 2 to a pillar and ignore the mushroom one, but be sure to block the boom!\n\nIf you have an off tank by the way, they should run around taunting all of the ghosts to make sure the 'Magic Bolts' attack stays off the group (the ghosts have the same effect as the boss) and also debuff them so people can kill them faster.\n\n|cffff00AOE bursts|r - Throughout the whole fight, the stacking and burning AND the killing of the ghosts, players will have nasty popping aoes under them. This is why you do NOT stack. You can step out of them if you can coordinate without running around like a headless chicken OR you can stand still and take heals.\n\nMOST important of all though, again, do NOT stack. stacking will make multiples land in the same place. If a dps/healer is hit by ONE at full health, they will survive, if they are hit with 2x, they WILL die!\n\nWatch your feet!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00THE CELESTIAL MAGE|r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nTHIS boss can be SUCH a mess, but it really doesn't have to be! The tank can have a hard time, the dps can have a hard time, and the healers can struggle all day long. BUT, i am going to explain to you how to do this with EASE and then of course add the hard mode mechanics at the end.\n\nThe tank should TAUNT the boss BUT! stay a few feet away, lets call it 'arm's length'!\n\nThe group (despite all other complicated methods you may have seen) Should stack BEHIND the boss.\n\nRead On...\n\n|cffff00CHAIN LIGHTNING!!|r - THIS is the single most hated mechanic in the trial and wipes people for countless hours because people do NOT understand it. So I'm going to explain what it DOES and then i will explain how to defeat it!\n\nChain lightning happens when the boss zaps a player and they are standing next to another player (too close). The chain gets stronger and stronger and the person at the end of it usually dies.\n\nThere have been many ways to lessen the impact of this but over time i still see groups not understanding how it works...and HERE is how!\n\nThe boss has a 180 degree field of vision. ANYONE in FRONT of her, can be her potential 'zap zap' victim...\n\nAnyone BEHIND her 180 degree field of vision will NOT. She only hits what she can see!\n\nSo potentially, if you draw an imaginary line through her center, 180 degree at front and 180 at the back, so long as you dont CROSS the line, you will NEVER get zapped!\n\nNOW, the tank CAN get zapped. Which means something else needs to be paid attention to.\n\nOn a Dragonnight for example, pierce armour has a 7 meter range, so the tank can stand WAY back and still maintain a taunt for the debuff, AND to keep her attention.\n\nThe melee, dps BEHIND the boss can also hit for about 5-7 meters away. SO, between the TANK (at the front 180) and the dps (at the back 180) try to make a MINIMUM of a 10 meter gap between you all!\n\nSo, tank stands back a bit, and so does the dps. With this method, the tank will always be the one to get zapped, and NO ONE will be in range to receive it! SO it will simply disappear! This tactic is applicable in the regular AND Hard Mode!\n\nNOTE: No matter what happens, NO ONE EVER CROSSES THE LINE! Selfish players thinking they are clever showing off and nudging over the imaginary line, will get zapped, and they are close to everyone else which means THEY will get zapped! Pay attention and stop dancing! :)\n\n|cffff00Axes|r - During the fight the mage will shout several different lines of dialogue, 'i cannot stop these weapons', and 'i cannot control my armoury' etc...when you hear this, she is spawning large purple axes. These need to be grabbed by the tank ASAP and kept with him/her at all times.\n\nDo NOT run through the group to taunt them because you will spin the boss and/or cause chain lightning.\n\nThe longer the fight goes on, the more axes you will get in the room and the harder it becomes for the tank.\n\nThe axes deal moderate damage BUT if they wind up a heavy attack and you don't BLOCK it, they will knock you down, stun you and potentially kill you. Or another axe will kill you while you are down. Don't miss the blocks!\n\nAlso what helps here is actually if you have an OFF tank, then you can split the axes between you and use some of the far side of the room to keep the axes away from the group.\n\n|cffff00Mines|r - During the fight mines will randomly appear on the floor. These can be avoided but do deal high damage if you are caught by them and also overtime can end up overwhelming the room with too many. You can ignore them for the most part if you prefer, BUT if not, any dps with a damage shield and full health can run into them to blow them up, or any stam dps with full health blocking while walking into them. Failing that if your off tank is doing nothing, tell him/her to activate mist form and simply run through them all, you wont get stunned while in mist form and you can get rid of many at a time.\n\n|cffff00Black Holes|r - These will spawn randomly around the room and MUST be avoided as they deal HUGE damage over time ticks.\n\nThe method above regarding the chain lightning (group behind the boss tank in front WITH a large gap) if the tank has to move left or right, make sure the whole group moves the opposite direction as to maintain the formation and be sure no one crosses the 180degree line.\n\nFailing that, the dps in the middle should for the most part if in position MISS these due to their placement. The only time it will be an issue(as stated above) is if the tank/healers get them.\n\nIn which case deal with it as a unit as and when it happens!\n\n|cffff00Reflections|r - During the fight you will see randomly in random locations a fast spreading aoe and then a burst! If you are inside this get out fast and reposition when it is gone. This is a reflection of the mage entering the room. These MUST be killed.\n\nAs soon as one is in the room switch your damage focus over to them and kill them.\n\nThey emit a rather nasty room wide damage over time and if you don't kill them fast enough you will end up with multiples and things will really get messy.\n\nRemember the 180 degree line? if the reflection is on the in the TANK's section, kill it with range. If it is in the DPS's section, you can physically run over to it and smack it to death and then return to your previous stacking spot, OR do the same as if it was on the other side and range it anyway, your choice.\n\n|cffff00Meteors (Hard mode only)|r - During the fight large aoe meteors will land on players heads. This is easy, BLOCK! If you don't block you will be stunned, if you DO block you will be fine. Pay attention!\n\n|cffff00Atronachs (Hard mode only)|r - During the fight as well as the Axes, you will get Storm Atronachs constantly entering the fight, these MUST be killed! The tank can position them close to the boss but remember that gap! You must NOT be too close in case you zap them.\n\nOR you can kill them at range, whichever is easiest. BUT they must be killed fast and even more so when they get to low health. At low health they will have a complete melt down and spam aoe lightning damage infinitely until they die. Execute these asap!\n\nThe tank can hold on to 2-3 of them occasionally so that you can nuke multiples at once, but whatever tactic works for you.\n\n|cffff00Execute!!|r - At around 15% the boss will knock the group down repeatedly 3x in a row. Any remaining Reflections SHOULD disappear here but they sometimes do not, so be sure they are all dead before you push her to execute phase! All axes will also be removed from the fight for the remainder!\n\nNOW it is about focus. The boss has a massive upside down nova heading slowly towards the group and the group takes massive damage over time, and this gets progressively stronger the longer the phase goes on.\n\nSo, healers need to focus heals as much as they can, tanks need to maintain a debuff from taunt while controlling stray Atronachs, and the group as dps players need to focus rotations like never before. Tanks can also help with damage shields for the group to help for survival! Nova, permafrost, veil, and any protection buffs you have as a group should be used wisely here\n\nstagger them throughout the final phase to keep everyone alive!\n\nbest of luck to you all!!!\n\n"

					name = "TRASH FIGHTS",
					mechanic = "|cffff00 TRASH FIGHTS |r\n\nThere are many trash pulls in this particular trial and they are for the most part relatively easy to manage. However there are some that prove to be a big problem even for the best of groups out there. The trick is fully understanding the mechanics of them individually and of course prioritizing targets in order! At the same time of course positioning is key for the tanks and the healers in order to be able to stack the adds/mobs while the healers can focus on keeping people up. There are a lot of opportunities in this trial for you to accidentally KILL your own group members if you are not careful!\n\n|cffff00Overchargers|r - These are your HIGHEST priority targets in the entire trial! Any overcharger in the room is already there too long, you MUST focus these targets at all times.\n\nThey fire off single target lightning attacks to whoever they are agroing at the time which can do fairly harsh damage to the players targeted by this. However that is not the main concern. The main concern is the overcharger lightning aoe effect. The overcharger will pick a random player and a large circular aoe on the player. This will last a few seconds (around 10 or so) and will constantly do damage. The healers need to focus this person and keep them alive. The danger here is when people don't understand the aoe.\n\nIF the player runs around they will of course overlap other players with the aoe and THEY TOO will take damage every tick. This aoe is physically attached to the player! So if they start moving, it stays with them!\n\nAn easy way to manage this is to simply stay out of the group when this effect is on you, OR stand completely still and let people move away from YOU.\n\nIn the mean time while this affect is active the overcharger will call down lightning bolts which hit the ground aiming also at the same player. These hit with very high direct damage. You can wiggle a little to avoid them but you must be extremely careful to not kill people with the lightning aoe you have on you. So again, it is safer to just block and let the healer do their job in keeping you up.\n\nThis mechanic alone(overcharger lightning) is what will completely wipe out groups over and over, you MUST kill them.\n\nAlso note in some parts of the trial there are Shaman enemies. These have a totem with them. The totem controls the location of the overchargers, they tend to run TO it. So if you want to control the over chargers as a tank and not have them run around...The group must KILL the totem. Not the sham himself, but the totem!\n\n|cffff00Trolls|r - These are your second priority targets. They are not so hard to deal with but they can be stubborn and also add a very nasty mechanic to the trial where complacent or selfish players will kill their group members! Taunting them can be a pain since they are melee targets but technically have ranged attacks, so you will need a capable tank to position these in a nice little stack if possible.\n\nThe trolls have a ground pound which can be avoided by simply not standing in it. This is a small aoe surrounding them and will go away after about 3-4 seconds.\n\nThey occasionally throw a boulder at a random player of their choice. The ONLY way to avoid this is to dodge roll. If it hits you it WILL knock you down even if you are blocking and you cannot CC break from it. Dodge roll it, or get dropped basically!\n\nFinally the most annoying ability in the trial which so many people get wrong and are not considerate enough to fix...The trolls will pick a random player and throw a small ball at them. You CAN (if you are quick) dodge roll this. If you dodge it you will completely avoid it. But if not, you will have a small pulsing poison damage over time on you with a small AOE on YOU!\n\nJust like the overcharger lightning this is attached to the player, which means if you run around like a headless chicken you will SPREAD it! Not only will you hit other people with it but you will give THEM their OWN new poison aoe. The more people touched with this the more it spreads and the longer it lasts, inevitably of course dealing more damage over time. Do NOT stack up, do NOT run around aimlessly and selfishly spread the poison to your entire group. Stand to one side and wait for it to disappear. You have NO need to stand on each other's heads. If you do, you will kill people!\n\n|cffff00Archers|r - These are pretty standard. They fire an arrow spray which you want to try to avoid, they fire off light attacks and of course they can fire a 'take aim' type ability where they pick a random player and wind up a long casting snipe. This is very simple. If you see an orange light on a player, or coming from the archers, simply bash/interrupt it, to stop it from happening. If this does hit someone it will do VERY high single target damage. If interrupted, it is not a problem. This is a low priority target but should be dealt with AFTER the trolls and overchargers.\n\n|cffff00War priests|r - These are extremely low priority. They have an aoe snare and they fire off heavy attacks which will knock people down. They do NOT hit hard but you want to avoid being knocked down. The tank should always hold these very still in with the priority targets and they will die to aoe. You do NOT need to focus these unless they are the last target left. Low priority, easy to deal with, kill everything else and these will die with the aoe from killing the priority targets.\n\nAll the tank will ever need to do is hold these still! Note if you are a dps or healer and one of these is attacking you, don't panic, simply block.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 POSSESSED MANTIKORA |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis fight is the first boss in Sanctum Ophidia and can be a massive challenge for new trials groups if they do not understand the mechanics and/or work together as a team. One wrong move can potentially cause a domino effect wipe!\n\nThe tank should of course taunt the boss and maintain a taunt at all times (see overtaunt below) and face the boss AWAY from the group.\n\nThe group should create a semi circle behind the boss so that everyone has their own space. NOT overlapping, NOT stacking (popcorn explained below for the purpose of this formation). You must have plenty of room. In the mean time, at least 2 dps and/or healers (can get away with more) need to play ranged and stay well back loosely stacked together. This is for kiting the shards (also explained below).\n\nSo in a nutshell, ranged dps together at the back, and everyone else semi circle spread out behind the boss while the tank holds it still. Simple!\n\n|cffff00Overtaunt!!|r - That's right! This boss can be OVERTAUNTED! Do NOT spam taunt. Make sure you apply it and keep the uptime on it passively of course but if you apply taunts too often (more than once every 7-10 seconds, you WILL make her completely lose the plot. The Mantikora if overtaunted will rampage around the room killing whoever she feels like killing until she has calmed down again. Do NOT spam that button!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Very simple, the boss will fire off a heavy attack. The tank MUST have the boss facing away from the group and the tank MUST block this attack or take HUGE damage. Failure to block is almost certain death and if not will knock you over. Pay attention to this attack!\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - This is also a very simple mechanic. The boss will cleave in frontal aoe. If any player is within it's reach it will cause massive damage (dps/healers will die to a one shot) do NOT stand in front or close to the front of the boss unless you are a tank.\n\n|cffff00Popcorn|r - This is where random players will see a fast growing aoe under their feet which will POP and explode throwing the player into the air (hence the name popcorn). However this doesn't just happen ONCE but 3 times! So if you get caught by one and it does not kill you, the next one will pop pretty much as you hit the ground and you WILL die. Do not get caught by this and do NOT run around like a headless chicken into your group.\n\nYour formation should be covered to accommodate for this mechanic. When you see it coming, run BACKWARDS (not side to side, not forwards, BACKWARDS!) in order to pull it away from the group. Once the 3rd pop has gone off you can come back in again and carry on as normal.\n\nTIP: If you dodge roll INSIDE of it, it will not harm you but try not to show off doing that too much because players with lesser skill and/or spacial awareness will actually run into others doing so. Use this as a tip to get back in quickly if you must however.\n\nBasically run backwards for 2x pops, and then dodgeroll THROUGH the last one back towards the boss.\n\nIf you cannot manage this, just go backwards till they are all gone.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - Usually after two popcorn phases the boss will do a large STOMP mechanic. This stomp is easily seen by a massive aoe that pretty much fills the entire room (everyone can see it, no excuses). When this happens everyone needs to BLOCK or they will die. Once blocked everyone will receive a bleed which does a HUGE amount of damage. The healers need to really be on point here to either heal people through it's duration OR heal them to full health. If any player hits full 100% hp during the dot, it will basically be cleansed. This does happen a lot throughout the fight so people must pay attention to this.\n\n|cffff00Portal|r - When you hear The Serpent's voice the Mantikora will be in a stunned state and a portal will randomly appear on the ground in the room. As soon as you hear that sound you MUST spread out! Doing this will present you with enough time to spot the portal and not have everyone fall in it at once!\n\nOnce you can see it, be sure that you assign 1 tank and one dps to go into it. It can hold 4x people but depending on your group capability you can get away with less. There is a reflection of the serpent down there. The tank should hold it still while the dps player/s kill it. It has relatively low health but has similar mechanics to the last boss (heavy attack and cleave). The tank must NOT spin the target because it will one shot a dps. Also if the tank fails to block the heavy attack, 9 times out of 10 the tank would generally be killed.\n\nThe most important thing to note about this phase is TIMING! When the portal is up, the boss will NOT cast ANY popcorn at all! This is your window to burn the boss. You will get shards and stomps but you will get no popcorn while the shade downstairs (in the portal) is alive.\n\nSo, what you can do is you can have JUST a tank downstairs and make everyone else nuke the boss IF you have extremely high dps. You can burn the shade quickly just so you can come back up and carry on the fight as normal...OR You can play tactically. The shade must be killed within 1 minute and 45 seconds. Have someone with a stopwatch as soon as that portal opens up.\n\nThis helps because you can deliberately make sure the dps player/s downstairs KILL the shade SLOWLY to give your team more time upstairs with the boss burning it with no popcorn mechanics present.\n\nONCE the shade is dead, all people in the portal will come back up and the fight will resume as normal. Unless the boss is of course dead.\n\n|cffff00Shards/spears|r - This is the reason for having people together at range. The shards are thrown at the furthest players throughout the fight after the portal phase and these land with an initial stun and do HIGH poison damage. The trick to this is to make sure the ranged stay together to deliberately place them where they want them. When the shard is on the way the players targeted should BLOCK. Once it lands, get out of the aoe quickly ready to recieve the next one. Basically you are being dummies at the back for these to be placed in a semi circle so they stay AWAY from the front of the fight.\n\nIf you do not systematically place these shards at the back(ranged locations) the will land in melee positions and then of course the boss will need to be moved a lot more than you want to in order to get the group out of danger.\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - At low health the boss will flash red and enrage doing more and more damage the longer it is alive. This is your window for basically 'KILL IT!!'. Hold it still and make it dead, do not panic ;)\n\n"

Pretty much the same mechanics for the troll king. BUT there are a couple of extras AND he hits a LOT harder. This troll is protecting his bridge and he tries REALLY hard to do so.\n\nThe tank should taunt the boss while maintaining a taunt of course and turn it AWAY from the group. It helps a LOT if people can help the group with damage shields (bone shield, igneous shields etc) if available within your group. If not, some damage mitigation bonuses (circle of protect etc) can also come in handy. People will take a LOT of damage here if they are not careful and sometimes even if they ARE careful.\n\nThe group should be positioned in a circle around the boss, but NOT in front of the boss! Only the tank belongs there.\n\nTwo adds (archer and war priest ) will come with the boss to start with. These should be positioned with the boss and generally should die passively during the fight with aoe damage, BUT i would advise you to focus them to make them less of a bother so you can concentrate on the boss mechanics properly.\n\n|cffff00Ground Slam|r - The boss will slam the ground with a HUGE very noticeable AOE. When this happens, the group inside of the circle should BLOCK to mitigate the damage.\n\n|cffff00Ground Pound|r - The boss will repeatedly punch the floor 3 times and there will be 3 straight lines of damage aiming at the tank. This needs to be blocked, BUT, sometimes these actually go behind the boss too! So whenever he is smashing the floor, everyone should BLOCK or else can be subjected to a ONE SHOT! Do not let this mechanic kill you.\n\n|cffff00Poison ball|r - This boss like all other trolls in Sanctum Ophida will throw a ball of poison at a random player. When this happens, if the player sees it coming, they can dodge roll and avoid it. If not they will suffer a poison damage over time aoe attached to them! They should stand aside and let it pass. If they touch other players, each person touched by it will ALSO receive it. It spreads, DON'T run around giving everyone your germs!\n\n|cffff00Enrage|r - At low health (20% or so) the boss will glow red and be enraged! He will deal MUCH higher damage and the mechanics need to be followed even stricter than before. If you do NOT block his ground slam, while he is enraged, you WILL die. Be careful.\n\n|cffff00Overchargers #NoCheese|r - Throughout the fight the boss will spawn overchargers which must be killed. There will be a shaman in the room who controls them, so if you kill him and/or his totem it is a lot easier for the tank to maintain agro. If the sham is alive they will run where ever the totem is and it can be a pain. So do make sure he dies.\n\nThe boss will spawn 1 overcharger at 75%, 2x at 50% and 3x at 25%. So yes you guessed it, if you DON'T kill the overchargers as they spawn, you can end up with 6x of them. Make sure they die!\n\nRemember of course as explained in the Trash Fights section, these can put nasty lightning aoes on the players so positioning and not panicking is key!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 OZARA |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis fight is every PUG's worst nightmare. Luckily for those of you whom have never seen this, a long time ago it was altered to decrease the difficulty, BUT it can still be a pretty big challenge for new groups. She has low health but there is a LOT going on.\n\nPositioning wise the tank should hold Ozara by the door way (closed door) on the right of the room as you come in. DO NOT stand too close to the door because she can heavy attack you through it and you can get stuck but loosely stay in that vicinity. This is to be sure that the damage is in the right location for when the adds come in.\n\nIn the mean time the group should be in a semi circle around the back of the boss and all have their own space. You do not want to stack and/or overlap. The off tank (if you have one) can do one of two things.\n\n1) hold the adds (troll, archer and war priest) close by to receive heals and help throw buffs etc at the group.\n2) Take all the adds to the corner of the room, hold them there and survive. DO NOT touch the overcharger, leave that with the group.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is pretty simple stuff. The boss will heavy attack whoever has agro (should be the tank) if she heavy attacks, be sure to block it. It doesn't hurt much but it will knock you down if you fail to block it and it makes positioning her a difficult task. Even a dps/healer can block this.\n\n|cffff00Overcharger|r - The door in which i have stated you need to fight in front of it where the overcharger comes from. It will spawn at the beginning of the fight and then continue to spawn every few seconds each time one dies. You MUST focus this target.\n\nIf you have a low dps group, make sure all single target is on the Overcharger and aoe down the boss each time one of these spawns. If you have a very HIGH dps group, you can get away with focusing the boss and killing the overcharger with aoe. It must die however so each spawn is really when you should be utilizing your ultimate abilities for the burn!\n\n|cffff00Shaman's Totem|r - There are many adds in the room and each one that dies will respawn! So you will have an endless flood of adds to deal with during the fight (small ones). However the Shaman is one you do NOT want to kill.\n\nHis totem controls the overcharger. If the totem is active he will NOT stay near the door so you can kill him, instead it will run to the totem and things get messy really fast (no control).\n\nSo you must KILL the totem (assign one dps to kill it at the beginning). If you kill the totem, the overcharger will never run away and be easy to deal with. The totem will NEVER respawn.\n\nBUT if you kill the shaman by accident (or even on purpose) he will respawn and make a NEW totem. DON'T kill the shaman, kill the TOTEM!\n\n|cffff00Pins|r - The boss will cast a spell with both of her hands in the air and PIN members of your group. This is the most important mechanic in the fight. People who are pinned cannot get out by themselves, they must be set free by the team/group by running over to them and activating a synergy.\n\nYou must free the player, and then get BACK into your formation. Do not panic, do not run around aimlessly. If you can reach someone close by, unpin them asap.\n\nThis can get a little messy because of everyone screaming 'I'm pinned'. This is very easy to fix. Simply don't do this! Anyone pinned to the ground should simply put out an emote, perhaps 'hello' or something, which will let the group know of their position. Tanks and Healers however should speak up because they are priority!\n\nAs the fight goes on the boss will place more and more pins on the group to a maximum of 4x people, so be quick on releasing these victims of the mechanic.\n\n"

The non hard mode is basically a stack and burn so long as the tank holds the boss still. But hard mode really tests people to see if they are paying attention or not and to see how much they understand about not panicking!\n\nThe main tank should turn the boss away from the group and hold it still at ALL times!\n\nThe group should stack on the circular pad BEHIND the boss and NEVER go in front of it.\n\n|cffff00World Shaper! (hard mode only)|r - This is the simplest and most difficult mechanic of the fight. It is extremely easy to execute but collectively it can sometimes be a nightmare to get people to work as a team.\n\nBasically the whole fight you want to be as close to the boss as possible (bit of a stack and burn) but this mechanic it is SO important that you stay close.\n\nThe boss will raise his hand and a growing green ball can be seen above him. This is where he is deciding which player randomly is going to get it! NO ONE moves! You do not yet know who the target is so stay still.\n\nOnce the boss's hand moves, he will throw the ball into the air and his chosen target will have it aimed at their head and will land on the ground with a HUGE aoe.\n\nThe way to work with this mechanic is simple. If you are the target and you run too soon, that mechanic will be going with you, and potentially will land where ever you are, including on other people's heads who ALSO tried to get away. Don't run early. Once it leaves the bosses hand it's location IS already decided...\n\nStay close to the boss, and as soon as the boss throws it, everybody RUN! It MUST physically leave the boss's hand BEFORE you start running!\n\nOnce it lands, everyone come back in again. Plain and simple. Run too early, people die, run too late, people die. Focus!\n\nSprinting by the way is much more efficient on both resources and maneuverability in this mechanic.\n\nAgain, in a nutshell...Stay close, stack up, his hand moves, you run, it lands you come back in. Rinse repeat.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The boss will heavy attack the tank and this MUST be blocked. If not blocked it WILL hit incredibly hard and possibly kill the tank outright.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - This cleave is HUGE in aoe and can wipe out the entire group in one hit. It has an incredibly wide arc so NO ONE but the tank should be in front of the boss and any time. This should also be blocked by the tank.\n\n|cffff00?Poison phase|r - The boss will teleport to the very center of the circle pad on the ground no matter where he currently is in the room and crouch down. The entire room will be filled with a high damage ticking poison dot. This is where stacking is important because the healers need to really spam out those heals here to keep people alive. Once the poison phase is over (about 10 seconds) you can carry on as normal.\n\nNOTE: if the off tank is too far from the heals, they can put on damage shields to help mitigate the damage.\n\nAlso note. There are 5x poison phases BEFORE the bubble/orbs phase (explained later)\n\n|cffff00Lamias|r - At the beginning of the fight before the first poison phase there will be 2 lamias spawning from the left corner of the room. These must be grabed and move away from the group by the off tank. If these get killed they will explode and one shot anyone caught inside of the explosion.\n\nBe sure that your off tank grabs these asap and they don't get stuck in the group. The off tank should keep these occupied to one side the WHOLE fight. They will scream (interrupt them) and they will also heavy attack (block). Above all be sure to maintain your resources while holding on to these but be careful while heavy attacking them if you need to because they sometimes block. Hitting a blocking target with a heavy attack will knock you off balance and you will have to break free.\n\n|cffff00Mantikora|r - There are 2 methods here. During the fight you will hear a flushing sound and from one of the blood pools will spawn a Mantikora. Overtime you can end up with 2x of these. How you deal with them is up to you. The first Mantikora will spawn after the 2nd poison phase. The second Mantikora will spawn after the 4th poison phase.\n\nMethod 1) The off tank takes the Mantikora/s to one side and holds them still with the Lamias at the back of the room away from the group. Until the bubbles phase.\n\nMethod 2) The main tank taunts the Mantikora/s IN to the group and the group kills it.\n\nBe aware the Mantikoras do heavy attack, which needs to be blocked by the tank and they DO have a MASSIVE stomp ability much like the first boss of the trial. Anyone who fails to block this...will die!\n\nIF your group is NOT capable of this simple mechanic. Make sure you apply method 1 and keep the Manti so far back that the stomp won't reach (bottom left corner up the stairs).\n\n|cffff00Magicka Bomb|r - The Blue totems that spawn during the fight will randomly put a magicka bomb on a player. When this happens the player will glow blue and a growing sound will erupt from them until it explodes!\n\nIf you dump your magicka and spend as much as possible (basically empty your bar to 0-10%ish) the bomb will explode, you will survive and you will be given some magicka back to carry on in the fight.\n\nHowever, if you fail to empty your bar, you will die when it blows up.\n\nThese blue magicka bomb totems CAN be destroyed however IF you wish to do so.\n\n|cffff00Pull totems|r - In the room not only do you have blue magicka bomb totems but you also have pulling totems. These will pull a random group member to them from wherever they are in the room. If you are pulled you need to dodge roll mid pull to break it. If you are quick enough it will put you back where you were. If not you will be snared heavily close to the totem and will have to dodge roll from where you are as far away from the totem as possible in order to break the snare and get back to the group.\n\nAgain, these totems CAN be killed if you choose to get rid of them.\n\n|cffff00Poison Totems|r - Poison totems look very similar to pull totems (green) and they physically connect with beams to the boss. This will buff his poison damage during the phases.\n\n|cffff00Orbs/bubbles|r - After every 5th poison phase (and at execute) the boss will fire out several pink shards across the floor. Every player must run to a shard each and this will caot the player in an orb/bubble. There is always one where the main tank is standing, so do NOT steal this, the tank needs it. And for the rest of the group you should assign at the beginning who goes left and who goes right. There is ONE for each player. Do NOT race each other for the same one, all get one each.\n\nIf you do not pick one up fast enough you will not get a bubble and the boss will cause an explosion and you will die. No bubble = dead.\n\nGo get your bubble, get back in the middle and carry on as normal.\n\nOnce the explosion actually happens all lamias, mantikoras and totems will also be killed. The fight basically starts again from scratch until the next orb/bubble phase.\n\n"

However there are some that prove to be a big problem even for the best of groups out there. The trick is fully understanding the mechanics of them individually and of course prioritizing targets in order! At the same time of course positioning is key for the tanks and the healers in order to be able to stack the adds/mobs while the healers can focus on keeping people up. There are a lot of opportunities in this trial for you to accidentally KILL your own group members if you are not careful!\n\n|cffff00Flame Shapers|r - These are HIGH priority targets. Their standard damage is not so bad and they can be killed fairly easy BUT when they raise their hand/staff into the air they will cast constant flame attacks to multiple targets in your group in the form of direct damage, and this hurts like HELL! As SOON as you see them raise their staff, they MUST be interrupted. If you fail to interrupt these within 2-3 seconds they can cause potential wipes! Most players cannot take more than 2-3 hits from this attack.\n\nPay attention, don't be lazy, don't assume the 'tank' is going to do the interrupting. You all know how to 'bash/interrupt' you were taught at level 1 in the tutorial. Put it in to practice and do NOT let the flame shapers channel their attacks!\n\n|cffff00Destroyers|r - These are a bit of a pain in the rear to be honest. Their general attacks are not too bad but these must be turned away from the group as much as possible. They have cleave effects which can hit multiple people and occasionally will fire off an attack with a cone effect. This is actually a knock down! The knock down itself does do a reasonable amount of damage but the danger comes from the follow up attack and damage from any surrounding enemies. Basically when you are knocked down you are helpless and open to attack and you cannot break free. So, be sure that if they fire off a cone attack you BLOCK it to prevent unnecessary deaths.\n\nSo in a nutshell, the tank should grab these as fast as possible and always turn them away from the group. If they do spin on the group (sometimes it is random who they hit) be sure to BLOCK, to take the edge off. OR simply get out of the aoe.\n\n|cffff00Gargoyles|r - These are pretty both easy, and EVIL! Your group needs to understand the mechanics to these or else you will get in trouble fast. The tank should always taunt these and turn them away from the group.\n\nDPS and healers should ALWAYS be BEHIND them. The gargoyle will throw out several attacks and flurries that will attack ONLY the person with agro (should be the tank). BUT the gargoyle has 2 major mechanics.\n\nThe gargoyle will cast a breath attack which will turn anyone in the aoe into stone (should be just the tank if you can help it). This requires you to break free to get out of it, so watch your stamina sustain.\n\nAfter TWO breaths (look for the second one), the gargoyle will have a large circle aoe around him and he will repeatedly slam the ground for a few seconds. GET OUT or DIE!. DPS will NOT survive this.\n\nSo to recap, after every second breath...get away from it!\n\n|cffff00War priests|r - These are extremely low priority. They have an aoe snare and they fire off heavy attacks which will knock people down. They do NOT hit hard but you want to avoid being knocked down. The tank should always hold these very still in with the priority targets and they will die to aoe. You do NOT need to focus these unless they are the last target left. Low priority, easy to deal with, kill everything else and these will die with the aoe from killing the priority targets.\n\nAll the tank will ever need to do is hold these still! Note if you are a dps or healer and one of these is attacking you, don't panic, simply block.\n\n"

Key issues with this fight generally are to do with the group positioning and trying to get people to not run around like headless chickens.\n\nThe tank should turn the boss away from the group at all times and the group should stand around the BACK of the boss in a nicely spaced out semi circle.\n\nNOTE: The boss's hit box is MASSIVE you do not have to be up his backside to do melee damage. Make space for everyone and do NOT stack!\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - At the beginning of the fight you will have 3 adds to deal with, the off tank should simply taunt these and hold them beside the boss turned away from the group. You can either decide to kill these first OR have them close enough to just let them die to aoe damage over time. The choice is yours, however they do follow the trash kills rules from above. Watch out for the cone attacks from the destroyers because they will knock people down. Keep them turned away at all times.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is very simple but devastating if missed. The tank will be heavy attacked and this MUST be blocked. If not blocked the tank will take HUGE damage and be thrown backwards/knocked back.\n\n|cffff00Winds/Gusts|r - The boss throughout the fight will cast winds that will be represented by small aoes. They will be randomly assigned to members of the group. There are two ways to deal with these.\n\nIf you have LOW heals and mitigation in your group the people with the aoes can kite out of the group until they fade and then come back in again.\n\nThe other method is even easier if your heals and mitigation is high and that is simply heal through them and stand still.\n\nKey point, do NOT stack. If people with aoe's stack they will double up and do more damage, also if you move to someone who does NOT have an aoe of course the damage will be on them too. Relax and plant your feet.\n\n|cffff00Swords|r - The boss will hug his hands around his body and then BURST with aoe flying swords which will fire off in multiple directions. They don't hit too hard and can be healed through however if you block you will mitigate a lot of the damage. The tank however should block this mechanic. However if you are fast you can actually interrupt this mechanic!\n\n|cffff00SPIN!!!|r - This is very simple but generally tends to wipe people not paying attention. At 30% health and below the boss will occasionally have a fast spreading aoe emitting from his body and when it hits max size he will SPIN rapidly with all of his swords spinning around his body. Anyone caught in this is pretty much dead. So when you see this, move backwards out of it until it is over.\n\n|cffff00Pro tip:|r If you are on the very EDGE of this mechanic, not quite touching it, you can still reach with all MELEE ranged abilities. This boss as mentioned above has a MASSIVE hit box, so no need to panic.\n\n"

Some tanks can manage a LOT of incoming damage and others not so much. So communication is important to be able to manage the adds in the fight if the group dps is low. The tank can do this in one of two ways, either hold the adds with the boss, or hold the adds to one side while the group deals with the boss. Whichever works best for your group is your choice.\n\n|cffff00Welwars|r - During the fight the tank will have to hold on to these at all times and be sure they do not run loose on the group. Throughout the fight there will be more and more of these to manage. Up to x4 Welwars is normally enough to manage for an experienced tank, but if it is too much or you get many more, you should kill these to prevent the tank being overwhelmed.\n\nThe Welwars will enrage during the fight and do higher damage. When this happens they will have very low health and should be killed if the tank is struggling (get people to execute it and then go back to the boss).\n\nThese do have mechanics for standing too close to their rear by the way. NO dps or healer should every stand directly behind a Welwar. If you do, they will kick you in the face with both feet which can be sometimes a one shot. There is a small aoe to present this mechanic, but positioning is really important.\n\n|cffff00Flames|r - The boss will cast a flame shot into the air which will hit the ground and burst into 4 lines on the ground. You can stand in the gaps to avoid this or the healer can heal you through it. It does hit fairly hard but since the boss should be taunted by the tank and the Welwars are covered by the tank this should be the only real damage you receive as a group so healing though it is quite easy. However if you struggle with survival simply watch your feet.\n\n|cffff00Reposition|r - Every 30seconds or so the boss will reposition himself so that he can get a ranged advantage on his target. When he does this simply follow him to his new location and continue dpsing him down. He is pretty much a standing target apart from this phase.\n\n|cffff00Revive|r - If a Welwar dies the boss will run over to it to revive it. This mechanic and the last one means you should plan you ultimates if you are using the split up tactic. If he runs off as you have just dropped an ultimate you will lose damage of course so timing is key.\n\nOverall if you have enough dps in your group in AOE, you can hold the boss AND the Welwar all together and it is a very straight forward fight. When the boss runs to reposition, the tank can simply follow him with the Welwars and re-stack in his new location.\n\nSplit them up or stack them up, it's up to you. Whatever works for you and your group.\n\n"

The tank should taunt the boss and the adds at all times if and when possible for agro and debuffs. The group however should position themselves spread out. Do NOT stack.\n\nThere are 4x targets. From left to right count them as 1, 2 3, and 4 and assign one dps for EACH one.\n\n|cffff00Split|r - The boss will split into 4.\n\n3x of them are fake and are immune to damage, but one of them is the real one. Each dps assigned to their number should focus on the boss (whoever has the real boss should call out its number). In the mean time, everyone should keep a close eye on THEIR add, and be sure that whenever they fire the flame shaper channeling ability (staff in the air flames coming out) they INTERRUPT the target ASAP!\n\nOnce the target is interrupted it will vanish. If you do not interrupt fast enough you will cause the group to take MASSIVE damage in a short period of time and inevitably they will wipe!\n\nEACH shade/add AND the boss can do this mechanic and sometimes you can have all x4 of them doing it at the same time. You MUST interrupt. This really shows whether people know the basic mechanics from the tutorial or not as interrupt (one of the game's simplest mechanics) is SO important here!\n\n|cffff00Pulsar|r - The boss and the adds can ALL cast a 'pulsar' type aoe ability. This is seen by them having a fast spreading aoe from beneath their feet. When it peaks it will explode and do massive damage. You MUST block this mechanic. If you have full health and block (with a shield too if you can help it for magicka dps) you will survive. If you are not max health while blocking you are likely to die. So this is where the healers need to stay on top of things.\n\nDO NOT DODGE ROLL!! IF you dodge roll, the effect will count as though it has still HIT you without a block active and you will take full damage and be ONE shot. Just because you are 'out of the circle' does not mean you will live, this will still get you every time!\n\n|cffff00Meteors|r - During the fight the boss will call down meteors on random players, this is why you must be spread out at all times. The meteor will cause the target to be stunned and then after will leave a fire circle on the ground.\n\nDO NOT try to dodge roll this because you will fail, get stunned and die. However what you need to do is simply, BLOCK and then hold block while walking out of this. This is extremely simple, but again, a basic mechanic (block) that can wipe people if they are complacent and/or refuse to apply the basic rules to this attack.\n\nBlock, walk out, carry on, don't stack!\n\n"

Quite possibly one of if not THE hardest hitting boss for a tank in the game. An experienced tank shouldn't have any issues, but an inexperienced one will need to know exactly what to look out for else take potential one shots to the face!\n\nGenerally for the most part the tank should hold the boss in the center of the room faced AWAY from the group. And the group should stay in a very tight stacked straight line.\n\nThe off tank (if you have one) should control any adds and bring them to the center near the boss (also turned away from the group) in order for the group manage them easier rather than scattering around the room.\n\nThere are some complicated things to consider as far as the hard mode is concerned for the tanks and the group BUT that will be explained below. Essentially excluding the beginning part (hard mode) the boss should be as above.\n\n|cffff00Shield Throw|r - This mechanic is pretty simple and the reason the group should stand always in a straight line! The boss will pick a random person (note this could be the tank). When that person is chosen the boss will face them and throw a shield at them (presented by a long strip aoe) and then the shield will come back again like a boomerang.\nWhen this happens everyone should move OUT of the aoe, and then back in again when it is gone.Formation is key, ALWAYS get back into a perfectly straight line/stack!Tank tip: If the boss throws the shield away from the tank, take this opportunity to heavy attack the boss for resources back ready to take on the repeating mechanics afterwards.\n\n|cffff00Stoned! (hard mode only!)|r - During the fight the boss will turn a random member of the group into stone. If the player activates a synergy they will EXPLODE, break out of stone and kill ALL group members in the aoe.\n\nThe way to manage this is one of two tactics.\n1) wait for the boss to throw his shield (hence why you stay stacked in a straight line) and his shield will be guaranteed thrown in that direction. While everyone else gets OUT of the aoe, the person in stone will be broken free. So whoever is in stone, stack on them.\n2) Method 2 is that you all move away from the person in stone, so that they can break free, and then line up and stack again. This tactic is actually very good at execute, but requires a lot of co-ordination.\n\nTIP: IF you are not extremely experienced in this particular mechanic, and cannot time it correctly with his attacks, there is a very very VERY strong chance you will try to take synergies and then get turned to stone. Meaning the synergy you actually active is the explosion...killing your group.\n\nTo make things easier, agree with your group that NO ONE shall take synergies for the entire fight.\nThis alone will help you pass this for your first few times until you master it.\n\n|cffff00Gargoyles (hard mode only!)|r - As you start the fight you will notice there are several gargoyles around the room. These are in stone, and will wake up during the fight. If they awaken, you will have to fight them. However, if you break them while they are in stone, they will die in one shot.\n\nSo the trick to this, is to make the warrior throw his shield AT the gargoyles while they are in statue form.\n\nThe way you ensure this happens is to manipulate the direction he throws it.\n\nThe tank should have his/her back to the gargoyle with the boss facing him/her, while the group stay BACK far enough from the aoe cleaves) yet still also in front of the boss. Ranged position basically behind the tank about 10 meters+\n\nThis way whenever he throws his shield it is guaranteed to go in only ONE direction. In order to be sure this happens however, everyone must be stacked either on top of each other or in a perfectly straight LINE!\n\nTWO at ONCE!: You can kill two gargoyles at once! The way you do this , is the same as above, BUT you be sure that the straight line covers the direction of two gargoyles. So the tank stands at the front one, and the group stands at the back one. Again in a PERFECT straight line.\n\nThis will take some practice and co-ordination, and if ONE person stands even an inch out of line, and is focused by the shield throw, it can go at an off angle and completely MISS the back statue, missing your opportunity of one shotting it. Pay attention, and work together!\n\nRepeat this process while traveling around the room as a unit. Kill two , move to the next set of two, line up, kill two again. Over and over until they are all dead. Take care not to allow the warrior to land in the blue circle (damage circle). If you do not kill them all fast enough or even MISS one, eventually they will start to wake up and you will have to kill them.\n\nThey have the same mechanics as all gargoyle previous to this room so watch your feet.\n\nADDS: Note during the gargoyle stage you will encounter adds, and these need to be positioned near the boss by the off tank (remember the straight line) if the group is too close, the destroyers will hit with knock down aoes which could be a problem if timed badly along side the bosses shield.\n\nFinal note: when the boss throws his shield, be sure to get OUT of it! No moving until he throws it, and when he does, be sure you get out.\n\n|cffff00Healing & Damage Circle|r - There are two large circles, one either side of the middle of the room. Each is connected to a statue. The yellow/orange circle is a healing circle where health recovery is heightened by a large amount, this applies to players AND enemies, so be careful that the boss/adds do not sit inside this or for at least long periods of time.\n\nThe blue circle is a damage boost circle. The players all get a huge damage boost for standing inside of it, but so do the enemies and the boss!! Do NOT let anything stand in this and/or for too long! If the warrior is standing in this hitting the tank, the tank WILL die!\n\nAt 85% he will run to the healing circle and smash the statue, removing this affect from the fight and then aim to jump at the furthest person away. When he runs to do this, everyone should be as close to the middle as possible ready to dodge roll the jump mechanic. He will jump to the furthest person away which is why everyone should move together in order to manipulate his position in your favor (explained below under 'jump' mechanic). Doing this will put him back in position for the tank, and then everyone can get back to where they were.\n\nHe will also do this for the blue damaging circle at 70% health. Simply rinse repeat the above tactic.\n\n|cffff00One Hundred, Thousand, Million, Billion Cuts!|r - The boss will cast a flurry like attack at whoever has agro (should be the tank). This flurry hits multiple times hitting extremely hard per hit and MUST be blocked. Failure to block will result in certain death. During this channeled attack however as well as blocking the tank MUST keep the boss faced away from the group. The attack is frontal AOE!\n\nAnyone caught in this or anyone stupid enough to deliberately put themselves in front of this ability WILL result in a borderline one shot! Watch your feet !\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will like many other bosses wind up a knock down heavy attack. You must block this or take HUGE damage and be knocked down.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - During the fight the boss will issue a CLEAVE attack which will hit very hard in frontal aoe. This should always be aimed at the tank, and the group should stay away from him when he does this. Getting caught by it as a dps or healer or even off tank with no block will result in a one shot. This generally happens after the shield throw.\n\n|cffff00JUMP!|r - This is a very simple mechanic. The furthest person away will make the boss jump on their head with a large crashing aoe.\n\nDO NOT run away from the boss all the time, you should be stacked close in a straight line with your group at all times (until execute). Anyone that thinks they are safe running away and/or moving too far backwards will get jumped on.\n\nIf no one is too far away this mechanic will NEVER happen. So if it does happen, then someone is doing something WRONG!\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - During the fight the there will be waves of adds which wake from stone. There will be 2x destroyers and 2x flame shapers. These need to be controlled.\n\nThe off tank should put the destroyers on the boss facing away, and then the flame shapers should be manipulated position wise so they can also enter the middle.\n\nThe way to do this as a tank, is to range taunt one and run BACKWARDS from the middle  making them run to you, once they reach the middle, do the same with the OTHER flame shaper from the other direction. Crisscrossing your position in this manner will bring the ranged targets IN so they can take damage with the boss.\n\nBasically, any ranged target will NOT follow the tank UNLESS they cannot reach him/her with their attacks, so you taunt, get OUT of their range, and they will run TO you in a straight line until they CAN reach. This tactic cam be applied throughout the game!\n\nIn the mean time, the group MUST keep an eye on the flame shapers, because much like the rest of the trial. All flame shapers MUST be interrupted as soon as they start channeling, else people will die.\n\n|cffff00Starfall! (EXECUTE Phase)|r - At 35% the boss will raise his sword into the air and blow the room up, knocking down walls, destroying treasure chests, knocking back the group, and killing ALL remaining adds in the room (so if any adds are alive at 35% they will all die ).\n\nNow the fight changes. The mechanics are relatively similar to before BUT he introduces a couple of nasty moves.\n\nInstead of stacking a in a straight line, you should spread out, quite close but with enough room to not stack on people's heads, around the boss in a semi circle.\n\nFrom now on, in the fight, every so often he will raise his sword in the air, and direct magic damage will be issued to ALL members of the group on repeat for about 5-6 hits PER PERSON. The hits all emit a ground based or located, aoe. And this is why you must be spread out.\n\nIf these overlap, you will kill each other because you will receive double damage.\n\nThe way to mitigate this, is that all players should BLOCK and shield if possible until the phase is over. Be aware of course outside of this mechanic you need to focus your dps because while he is channeling this, he WILL heal.\n\n|cffff00Energy Wave!|r - Instead of the shield throw the boss will now cast an energy wave along the floor. This has the same visual for the aoe area as the shield, BUT instead of being thrown out and then coming back again, this is a single cast. Anyone caught in this will die, and if they do NOT die, they will be knocked down! Avoid this!\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - After every WAVE attack, the boss will turn to the tank and cleave them with a hard hitting aoe frontal attack. Whenever you have avoided the wave attack, watch your positioning until the cleave is over because anyone caught in this will die. The tank can block it, others cannot. Resume formation and continue hitting the boss.\n\nRinse repeat the above starlight, wave and cleave phases until the boss is dead.\n\nHARD MODE ONLY (positioning and coordinating): At this phase (35% and under) position is key, you can pretty much call your positions from your perspective as a dps, healer (not tank) 'Left, Right, Middle'...spread players across these locations while facing the middle platform. Remember to stay quite close in this semi circle formation. If you stack people will die at Starfall, and if you spread TOO much, the boss will jump at the furthest person and make things difficult. Focus...\n\nIf someone is turned to stone...they should call their current location (left right or middle) IF YOU are not the one in stone, and you are at this location, you should MOVE away, so they can break free. Once they have done so, resume positions and rinse repeat.\n\nThere are other ways to do this but for training purposes this is incredibly CLEAN. Other more stacking methods require a lot more co-ordination and practice.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!\n\n"

What i mean by play fair, is people really need to try to NOT just run around taking cleanse pads and leave everyone else with nothing. Discipline your group and if you have to die for the sake of someone else, suck it up.\n\nIf you dance around you will misplace pillars, you will spread curses, you will basically just case the fight to prolong which means the group will eventually wipe since the fight is technically on a timer. The longer the fight the more chance of a final BOOM which will kill you all.\n\nThere are 6 pads around the room (enough to share 2 each) so assign your group to 2 a pad to start with. Stick to this rule all the way through and don't deviate from this unless you REALLY have to.\n\nThe tank should tank the boss in the middle or near his/her own pad and of course not drop agro.\n\nWhen the fight starts the group should surround the boss in 2 semi circles (melee up front and range behind) close together but NOT stacked (about 2-3 meters apart). IF you stack you will kill everyone, so be sure the ranged are not too far out, but not standing on people's heads. EVERYONE must have their own space.\n\n|cffff00Curses/pads|r - These are very simple. Every curse phase the boss will raise his hands and curse 3x people randomly. These 3 people must go to a pad and cleanse and then come back in again. There are 6x pads, each one is on a 25 second timer. If one is taken it wont respawn until 25seconds have passed.\n\nWith 6x pads and 3x curses this means every 1 phase, 3 pads will be used. By the time the second phase comes up, another 3 will be used, and by the 3rd phase, the first 3 should be re-spawned and this should go on a loop. There should ALWAYS be a pad free.\n\nHOWEVER there is a catch. The reason you MUST be spread out is because the curses will SPREAD to more players IF they are hit by someone else's curse aoe when it lands. If this happens you will run out of pads, people will be cursed for too long and die.\n\nWhen this happens if you know there is no time to get to a pad, OR you have none to go to , keep doing what you are doing and suck up the death ready for someone to resurrect you.\n\nIf you are assigned a pad at the beginning and are sharing it with a healer. If you are cursed, always check to see if they are cursed or not. If you are a dps and a healer needs the pad instead of you, stay where you are and let the healer take it. Tank and healers are priority survivors for pads else things will get messy fast!\n\nNOTE: If the tank gets cursed, the tanks should swap positions (off tank takes the boss while main tank gets cleansed and then swap back when safe, don't move the boss around the room though.\n\n|cffff00Cats|r - Every 20% of the bosses health 4x cats will appear in the room and randomly attack players in the group. The main tank OR the off tank should pull these into the fight (under the boss if possible) and control them. They will not respond do taunts (apart from the debuff) but can be CC'd. The group should focus these down fast(with ultimates if they have them) and/or do as much aoe damage as possible.\n\nThis phase repeats at 80% 60% 40% and 20% of the boss's health.\n\n|cffff00Pillars|r - During the fight the boss will aim at a random player and swing his hammer at them making a pillar spawn out of the ground. This is why people should not hang around near pads, because you want to keep these CLOSE!\n\nThe first phase he will eventually spawn 5 pillars. Once this happens he will pray and create a massive explosion and anyone caught in it will take a one shot and die.\n\nThe way to survive is for everyone to hide behind ANY pillar. Doing so will protect you and the pillars will disappear. Once safe the fight will carry on as normal.\n\nThis phase will repeat through out the fight with less and less pillars per phase.\n\nFirst phase is 5, then 4, then 3 , then 2 , then 1 , then NONE!! If you get to the ZERO pillar phase and he starts praying, and you don't kill him before the explosion, it is a wipe and you are all dead.\n\nIt is crucial that you follow the mechanics of this fight and avoid as many deaths as possible because, deaths cause wasted time spent, and wasted time pushes you closer to a zero pillar phase.\n\n|cffff00Shield Phase|r - During the fight at 70% health and 30% health the boss will cover himself in a damage shield which will place a bursting aoe under the members of the group (one each). It will pulse with damage over and over getting faster and faster the longer the boss has a damage shield.\n\nThis is where your group need to move in closer and focus on as much damage, mitigation and healing as possible BUT above all DO NOT STACK! The bursting circles must NOT overlap, else people will of course take damage from other people's aoes. Focus, relax, and take the damage shield off the boss. Once it is gone, the fight continues as normal.\n\nThis is a great time to throw in a Nova or permafrost, or both if you have them available to help the group take less damage. If you have a low damage group this is still doable but you will need to pump out more heals as it will take longer and get more aggressive. Don't panic!\n\nNOTE: you do not need 90k+ dps for this. 25k+ each and ALIVE and solid mechanics is more than enough to complete this, BUT be sure that it is clean and focused. You will have to stay alive as much as possible to do so else it will get messy.\n\n"

The TWINS! This requires true group co-ordination and understanding of mechanics!\n\nYou need your group to split into 2x groups of x6 players. One tank, one healer and 4x dps on either side.\n\nThe way the fight works is, each team will have colours on their heads. You must ONLY stay with people of the same colour head as you, (yellow of blue) if you touch or go near anyone of an opposing colour, you will both explode.\n\nAlso for damage output, IF you hit an enemy that is the same colour as the colour on your head, you will ONLY do 10% of your maximum damage. You must always hit the OPPOSITE!\n\nIt is important that you are clear what colour your team is and what the boss is. And once sorted, the tanks must be sure to swap their bosses so their groups can hit the correct targets. This is very important. Stay with YOUR group unless the mechanics tell you to do otherwise...and they will...\n\n|cffff00Original!|r - This is the term for the tanks. When the fight starts, one team will taunt the yellow boss and one team will taunt the blue boss. The tank from each side must remember THAT boss, is their 'original' boss. THIS IS CRUCIAL! - Explained more below under 'originals phase'.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - Each side will be presented with a blue add/yellow add and both are different in how they react. The blue adds are ranged and very similar to sun eater types. While the yellow ones are actually more melee types which will respond to taunts and run to the player rather than hit them from range (although they have ranged attacks).\n\nEACH fresh phase there will be an add phase 10seconds after the colours have been given out.\nIt will start with 1 add of each, then 2 then 3, then finally 4 which can be mayhem. The amount of adds depends on how far you are into the fight health wise on the boss.\n\n|cffff00Yellow adds|r - These have reflective light abilities which MUST be purged/cleansed and also a jesus beam (radiant Oppression) Which must be interrupted because otherwise the target they are hitting will be stunned until they die! So it is key no matter what to stay on interrupts.\n\n|cffff00Blue adds|r - throw out nasty orbs across the room so you want to be sure these are always faced away from the opposing team (they do more damage to people with yellow heads).\n\nThe team attacking the yellow boss, must control and kill the yellow adds.\n\nThe team attacking the blue boss must control and kill the blue adds.\n\nThe yellows are simple because a ranged taunt will control them but the blue ones not so much, you will need chains, portals, silverleashes etc in your group or a very flexible tank capable of manipulating them.\n\nAbove all however, however you decide to position these, you MUST kill these at ALL costs. If you end up with adds when the phases ahead kick in, it can be a real mess.\n\nSo above all, always focus the adds!\n\n|cffff00Yellow Boss (S'kinrai)|r - This boss has some frontal cleaves that need to be block and of course turned away from the group.\n\nHe fires reflective light much like the yellow adds which must be purged/cleansed. And finally he has a jesus beam (radiant oppression) which will usually be aimed at the tank to pin them to the ground and this Must be interrupted.\n\nTanking this boss in the middle of the one side of the room is actually perfect since it puts you in a good position to bring the adds in. Stack and burn this boss without moving!\n\n|cffff00Blue Boss (Vashai)|r - This has a few light attacks and a heavy attack that will knock back anyone caught by it so be sure this is on the tank at all times. Blocking this will cause you no problems at all since it is weak through block.\n\nHowever this boss does have a negate buubble in which he will cast 2-3 of per phase. This will USUALLY be aimed at the tank (but not always) hence why in the video instead of tanking him in the middle of the team's side of the room, the tank hugs the wall and physically decoys for the bubbles to land where he is standing. Each one that is placed will then make the tank move out of the bubble into a safe spot against the wall ready to recieve another. Slow kiting the boss from bubble to bubble until the phase is over.\n\n|cffff00Conversions|r - This phase the bosses will pray (as shown in the video) and 3x people from EACH side at random (not the tanks) will be notified of conversion with a colour under their feet. This is when you must SWAP sides FAST.\n\nBasically your head colour is now about to change...if you don't change fast enough, you will be with the now WRONG team and blow people up.\n\nSo 3x people from each side, Swap sides fast! Do this clockwise as not to confuse things.\n\nWhen they are in place they will be on a different boss with a different colour head and cary on as normal.\n\n|cffff00Switch or Stay??!|r - Shortly after 'conversions' the bosses will teleport to opposite sides of the room, one close to each of the teams. THIS is where you need to focus on what you were just doing...\n\nIF the boss next to you is the boss you were just hitting (different colour to your head) then you are fine...'STAY' where you are and keep fighting (but get close).\n\nIF the boss near you has the SAME colour head as you, run like hell and 'SWITCH ' in a clockwise direction and hug the other boss on the other side of the room.\n\nSo to simplify. If the boss is opposite of your colour, STAY if it is the same as you, SWITCH.\n\n|cffff00Originals Phase|r - THIS IS FOR THE TANKS.\n\nStraight after the 'switch or stay' phase, the bosses will pray and the room will explode removing all colours from all players, shortly after all players will recieve the colour of the boss they are closest to... This is the tank's only opportunity to get this right...\nRemember the first boss you taunted? What colour was it? before people get their colours back, RUN TO THAT BOSS NOW!\n\nIf you are already where you need to be, stay where you are and stay with the boss you are near (dont taunt it) and get your head colour...once you have it, taunt the opposite boss and carry on just like you started from the beginning.\n\nIf you are NOT with the correct boss, you need to RUN to the other side of the room to get in position before colours are given out.\n\nBasically during this 'no colour phase' there is a brief window where you can reposition. Once it is over you need to be sure you are near the boss you want the colour of when they dish out the pickings. If you are too far away or in the wrong place, BOOM, people are going to die.\n\nTIP: When going to your original boss, your NEXT phase is to taunt the opposite one (remember? tanks swap once you have colours just like the beginning pull)...to save your self a bit of hassle, IF you have to run across the room...\n\nInstead of running, getting your colour, turning back , taunting the other over the line (Swapping bosses) and then repositioning...\nMake it simple for yourself, Instead, taunt the bad one, run to the good one, and when you GET to the correct side, when you GET your colour, the bosses will have stopped praying and you will already HAVE the agro of the one you want, and he will simply, run to you from the other side of the room.\n\nTHIS will take some practice but once you nail it, it gets a LOT easier.\n\nNOTE: once this phase is over, you repeat the first step all over again, adds, conversions, switch or stay, originals. Rinse repeat.\n\n|cffff00Execute|r - Execute is tricky, both bosses have seperate health bars although they share an overall. PACE your damage. Be sure to keep them close together % wiese at the end. And if you have to, ease up on one or the other to level it out.\n\nThe reason for this is. Once ONE boss dies, all colours will go away, you will all be able to focus one target, and another 4x spawn of the colour boss whom is alive will appear (so yes you can have 8xadds+ around). When this happens you only have 20seconds to kill it, or he will enter the middle of the room, pray, explode and you all die...no pressure.\n\nBasically pace your damage at low health and don't yolo, it CAN kill you.\n\nWhen the adds are in the room, the tanks should control the adds if possible while the group finishes them off. It is advisable to kill the yellow one first so that you don't end up with 8x jesus beamers, that can hurt.\n\nNOTE: it doesn't matter how many laps it takes for you to complete this, it doesnt matter if you have to kill 4x adds per side every single phase, as long as your mechanics are clean and you DO 'focus the adds' at all times. Then it is just rinse repeat. When people panic, they fail, when people over burn one boss and not the other they fail. So relax, follow the mechanics and you will do it!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 RAKKHAT |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThe final boss has MANY mechanics that on the surface look very difficult to deal with but trust me, the twins are harder. If you have managed the twins, Rakkhat will be done! You will require some serious co-ordination in this one if you are going all the way and not nuking it so pay close attention to the mechanics of this one, and above all, no DANCING!\n\nThere are 8x pads in the room around a large middle one. Each dps(8) should be assigned a pad from the numbers 1-8. This is crucial and people MUST remember their pads (later mechanic).\n\nAlso the tank (main tank) must be the ONLY person allowed on gold pads. It has a buff on it which protects against rakkhat's heavy attacks and hits since they are extremely high if not protected.\n\nOnly one person can stand on a pad at once, so no one else must ever touch it or the tank will lose the buff and die.\n\nBLUE pads must be avoided at all costs!\n\nFormation: As described in the video it helps if you have two semi circles. One at the front surrounding the pad and one at the back not far from the front circle but NOT stacking!\n\n|cffff00Main tank gold pads|r - The tank must be the only one using these pads. Every time Rakkhat jumps HIGH up into the air (WAY high!) after a period of time, he will land and turn the pad blue, just like he does at the beginning of the fight. The tank must run to the next clockwise gold pad in the sequence before he lands, ready to place the boss on the next pad. This will happen EVERY pad, so be ready for this mechanic. Some pads change faster than others especially 2,4,6, and 8.\n\nEach time the tank is on a gold pa of course rakkhat will jump to the tank and stun them. They must break free and then be sure to turn him away from the group at all times while keeping him still as possible.\n\n|cffff00Machine gun|r - Much like lord warden, Rakkhat will fire off a magic machine gun at the tank, the tank must block while receiving heavy heals and if possible make use of absorb missile/shimmering shield or whatever damage/absorbing shields they have while blocking.\n\nThis does HIGH damage and is very important that survival is heavily focused on during this phase.\nBe sure that the boss is NOT facing the group and that no one is near the tank, this is directional so anyone caught by this will take a one shot.\n\n|cffff00JUMP!|r - The boss will jump occasionally heavy attacking the tank and doing a large aoe knock back. EVERY member of the group in range of this MUST block. If they do not they will be flown across the room and USUALLY into something stupid. Landing on cleanse pads, blue curse pads and all manner of stupid is the number one fail in this fight because people don't pay attention to block. You MUST block this!\n\n|cffff00Meteors|r - This is a simple yet deadly mechanic. If the group are positioned apart but co-ordinate much like the demonstration in the video then most should only ever get hit with one or perhaps two meteors and will be safe. BUT if people overlap they will be hit with multiples and overlaps and die. So position is key here.\n\nAbove all however to make this much easier is to assign players (2-3) to kite the meteors away. Basically the back part of the group (the furthest away ) every time Rakkhat raises his arms shouting 'a storm approaches' should run away and the meteors will follow. Do not run over each other, all go different directions and have your own space. The meteors will land behind the players so long as they move fast enough and when the phase is over they can come back into the group again.\n\nThis tactic is crucial for hard mode as the meteors do MUCH more damage there.\n\nNOTE: IF you have very high mitigation, heals and good formation, you can actually survive these standing still as a group. BUT that will take a bit of discipline!\n\n|cffff00Hulk!!|r - The hulk is a very simple addition to the fight but many people underestimate it or overestimate their ability to ignore it.\n\nBasically he hits like a wuss but he DOES have a one shot rule that many like to call 'two smashes'. He will hit the off tank with a SMASH ability which will debuff them. If this hits them TWICE they must call the other tank to taunt it off them (basically playing piggy in the middle with it. If the other tank receives the same, then swap back.\n\nThe reason for this is, if you receive a third one, you are dead!\n\nThe simple way to make this mechanic less stressful is of course to get the group to FOCUS the hulk with everything they have. Kill it fast, and you don't have to keep dealing with it in the room. Kill it slow and you risk causing problems and also overlapping of multiple hulks which you do NOT want.\n\nThey have an aoe stun which MUST be interrupted else the whole group will get stuned, usually during crucial mechanics. And these Hulks are also based on position of the fight...They spawn every SECOND pad.\n\nSo basically one hulk on pad 2,4 6, 8. Pad 8 is crucial. If you have not pushed the boss to execute by pad 8, you are going to the 'lunar phase'. If that happens you do NOT want the hulk in the room, so pull him to one side, and kill it fully focused as fast as you can. Failing that you will have to get someone to beam it during lunar phase. That will make more sense later and/or if you have watched the video.\n\nAbove all, to keep things simple, focus the hulk and if the tank gets smashed twice, swap with the other tank and keep doing so until it is dead.\n\n|cffff00BOMBS|r - From the end of pad two till the end of pad 3 players will randomly see a spreading circle aoe under their feet. This is a 'bomb'. I have seen many people run off to the side with these to blow them up in the corner and run back.\n\nHowever based on the formation demonstrated in the video we are able to stay still when these bombs are happening so long as people watch their feet. We are situated in a semi circle where there is enough room for the bomb to explode and touch NO ONE. when it goes off, the player will be stunned and have to break free and the small orbs that come from the bomb will need to be blocked or out healed by the healers as they pass by.\n\nIf you can apply this method you will have MORE time on the boss and less running around. Running through the group with it can be dangerous because if the circle touches someone as it explodes it will kill them.\n\nSO two methods, the one in the video which is incredibly safe if you co-ordinate, OR just take it out of the group to a safe place. The choice is yours but running around with it or touching someone with it is insta death. Be careful!\n\n|cffff00Tether and Popcorn|r - On pad 5 (this one is risky) you will have small blue balls that attach themselves to players in the group while the middle LARGE pad will have popcorn type shots flying at the players.\n\nTry to avoid standing too close to the middle pad as this is NOT pleasant.\n\nThe tether balls however can be dealt with in TWO ways depending on your group and focus. You can either kite them away from the group until they separate and disburse, OR you can do as we did in the video and put as much mitigation, damage shields, heals and vigors out as possible on rotation and simply TANK them (note you will need high spell resistance).\n\nI made sure in my own group that ALL stamina dps put down a circle or protection/vigor every 10 seconds on that pad to help the group and it worked a treat, but it all depends on your group. BUT again co-ordination is key. Stay in your formation, don't panic, and only move if you MUST.\n\n|cffff00BIG boom balls!|r - On pad 7 there will be very large spheres that appear randomly on players emitting a large round aoe. When you see these simply move away from it while taking heals, wait for it to pop, and then get back in to your position again (be aware of overlapping mechanics). These are simple and very easy to see but can cause a mess so dont panic.\n\nYou can of course also out heal and mitigate these if your group is built as such.\n\n|cffff00Assassins (hardmode only)|r - On hard mode when the shadows out the back are being killed (every runner phase), every 2x shadows will spawn an assassin from the middle pad. The off tank should pull these into the group and they should be killed quickly, either with aoe or simply focus them down.\n\nThere are 6 shadows so every 2 you will get one add, amounting to a total of up to 3x assassins. be SURE to kill these or you will get overwhelmed especially if you still have a hulk alive.\n\nThey don't hit particularly hard and have quite low health in comparison to the hulk, BUT they do attack with a whirling blades/steel tornado effect. When you see this large spinning aoe you MUST block or you will be throw across the room just like Rakkhat's jump mechanic. Usually into a blue pad and die!\n\n|cffff00Runners!|r - On pad 3, 5, and 7 the shadows of 6 void callers will appear in the middle pad of the room. These represent shadows in the back yard. You should assign 2-3 'runners' capable of dealing with these.\n\nNOTE: 2 runners is harder but safer for cleanses given that there are only 4 cleanse pads (lunar phase counts as the last cleanse but that is coming).\n\nThere is a gateway out to the back of the area which has 3 arch ways. One left, one right and one middle. Each direction needs to be explored and is each hiding TWO 'void callers'.\nNote: Going through the gate will curse you with a blue curse.\n\nBasically how this works is, there are synergies on the floor which must be activated and in doing so you try to uncover shadows. if you don't find one you move onto the next and so on. If you DO find one, be sure to kill it.\n\nWhen it is dead, which ever side it is from will remove one shadow from the representing side of the shadows in the middle of the room in the main fight area.\n\nOnce two left two right and two middle shadows have been killed, all of the shadows in the main room will have gone and the runners can come back into the room to cleanse their curses with one of the 4 cleanse pads around the main room.\n\nWhile on your journey in the back room/yard you will also meet other issues. There are blue orbs flying around which you should avoid or die VERY fast, there are gaps to jump in order to get to certain locations, and occasionally you will not uncover a shadow but you will uncover a 'void assassin'!. These hit VERY hard and have low health so survive and kill these asap!\nTIP: Don't jump gaps just after engaging with these as they snare and you will fall\n\nIF YOU FAIL to find all of the 6x shadows in due time, the shadows in the main room representing them, will sink into the ground and pull the whole group with them, yes...it's a wipe!\n\nThis will take a lot of practice so please be patient with your runners while they are practicing this and perfecting their chosen side and/or route while they are out there.\n\nThere are many maps online of the routes people LIKE to take and what they decide is 'best' but honestly it is up to you, whatever you find easiest and also remember they are RANDOM! You COULD find them in the first two synergies, so the route no longer matters!\n\nPractice makes perfect on this one.\n\n|cffff00Blue curses (especially hard mode)|r - Blue curses, from running out the back or standing on a blue pad will lower your healing received and also make you take one shots from meteors and other blue damage/curse type abilities. Also if you are blue and you touch a blue pad you will DIE from the second infection.\n\nCleanse pads can remove the curse but you should be saving these for the runners else they will have to die and be ressed to loose it.\n\nHARDMODE curses are different. The same rules apply BUT if you get too close to another player you will hit them with rapid fire blue orbs which will kill them quickly so you must keep your distance OR not get cursed. Also no cleanse pads are available on hardmode.\n\nTIP:IF you are doing hard mode and you cannot manage people cursed in your group, assign 2x ressers.\n\nWhen they come out of the gate they can run straight in and die on the edge of a blue pad near the group and then the ressers can get them up FAST ready for the next running phase fresh as a daisy!\n\nIf you are not going for scoreboard runs of course ;)\n\n|cffff00LUNAR PHASE|r - This is the most creative, fun, group training mechanic in the game in my oppinion and can go two ways...a gracious dance or a cluster f*$%. So pay VERY close attention here!\n\nThere are 8 pads in the room (as described also in the video). Each dps needs to be assigned a pad from 1 - 8 and stick to it.\n\nAfter pad 8 lunar phase will commence and everyone must get to THEIR OWN pad and not stand on it until it is GOLD (note all runners or all curses will be removed due to lunar so don't panic just be sure not to touch the blue stuff).\n\nThe tanks and healers should be in the middle.\n\nEvery single pad will have an add on it at random (sun easter, savage, shadowguard). Everyone must kill their own add with help from their friends BUT only under one condition...they MUST be affected by a debuffing BEAM coming from the center of the room else they will never kill it.\n\nEach player must also pay full attention to their own add in order to survive and BLOCK any potential heavy attacks. If you don't block your own add's attacks you will be knocked off the pad and you will die!\n\nThe 2x tanks in the middle and ONE healer (the other will heal people) will be taking synergies and aiming at specific adds IN ORDER so that each beamed target maybe killed by its owner and nearby allies. Once the beam is over, the synergy will move to the NEXT target on the beamers right and so on and so forth.\n\nThe beams as described in the video as as so.\n\nTank one - beams 1 , 2, and 3 (in that order)\nTank two - beams 4, 5, and 6 (in that order)\nhealer one - beams 7, and 8 (and then whichever is still alive afterwards if any)\nhealer two - heals heal people who are taking damage while using NO SYNERGY SKILLS (do not use any skills that emit synergies as they interfere with beams).\n\nNOW, to be sure that the group is hitting the correct targets of course the people with beams should be shouting out the target they are hitting while the group should be LOOKING at which beam is on which target also.\n\nThe group should be hitting targets as the beams hit the targets in THIS order!\n\nPad 1 - hits 1, 2, then 8\nPad 2 - hits 1, 2, then 3\nPad 3 - hits 4, 2, then 3\nPad 4 - hits 4, 5, then 3\nPad 5 - hits 4, 5, then 6\nPad 6 - hits 7, 5,  then 6\nPad 7 - hits 7, 8, then 6\nPad 8 - hits 1, 8, then 7\n\nIF ANY are alive after this then remaining targets should be weakened with beams while the players that can reach do as much damage as they can.\n\nNOTE: You must not leave your pads until Rakkhat lands, as much ranged damage as possible to help your friends and also, if you fail and any are left alive. They will run around and one shot people for a few seconds. Get distance and recover. Or wipe and start again.\n\nOnce this phase is over, all of the pads reset to normal, all curses are gone and you fight from the middle pad to pad one again and do another lap around the room rinse repeating all of the above mechanics until the fight is reaches execute.\n\n|cffff00Dreadstalkers|r - IF you go as far as lunar and you have not yet killed the boss, the new lap around the room will add a new mechanic. EVERY pad, new dread stalker will spawn. These will need to be killed or controlled. They follow the same rules as all others you have encountered in the trial. Arrow spray must be avoided. There is an achievement for these but that is up to you to handle else i run the risk of having to do a guide fo all achievements. lets say for now, make sure they die! :)\n\n|cffff00EXECUTE|r - When the boss reaches 12-13% health he will teleport into the middle of the room and raise his hands in the air calling down what i can only describe as 'DOOM!'. During this phase he has heightened resistances and is much harder to kill. This is when all of the pads in the room surrounding the middle will be blue.\n\nStarting with pad one an orb will appear and be connected to the boss. If a player runs over this and collects it, they will reduce his resistances but will now be cursed (be extra careful on hardmode).\n\nNOTE: you must get OFF the pad of which you picked the ball up from fast, and also do NOT attempt this if you are cursed because you will die and fail to pick it up.\n\nOnce the first orb is picked up, a second player can take number two pad orb and then someone else for three and four and so on.\n\nYou can ONLY do this in order and can only pick up each orb after the previous one is gone. Each orb collected will reduce his resistance and make it easier for him to be killed.\n\nIf your execute phase gets to the 8th pad orb, and he is not dead, you will all explode and die. So where this does require damage as such, the simplest way to finish this successfully is to co-ordinate well enough to take down his resistance faster for an easier ride.\n\nFor formation it helps if your group stays roughly between pad 1-4 in a semi circle for heals. It helps if the two tanks and perhaps healers got for pad 1-4 so te dps can continue to damage the boss.\n\nAlso one final note, during execute, bombs, large orbs and tethers will be present so HIGH mitigation and heal will be required and strong focus for the group not to get execute panic.\n\nBEST OF LUCK!!\n\n"

However, in the video i was clearly a stage 4 vampire and did just fine. The trick is understanding the mechanics and of course that is what i am here for!\n\nThe tank needs to taunt the boss at all times of course and try to stay still while the croup should be BEHIND the boss whenever possible to avoid complications.\n\n|cffff00Meteor|r - This is a very simple mechanic. Every player will be presented with an aoe and a meteor is on way! So spread out and make sure NONE overlap and hold block. Once it lands go back to where you were and continue with the boss. Note, if your resistances are low or your health is not 100% you CAN take a one shot even if blocking so be sure to keep up those heals and buffs during this phase!\n\n|cffff00Flame Atronachs|r - These can be taunted, killed or ignored. The choice is yours alone as a group. If you ignore them and focus the boss you WILL however have to deal with incoming fire balls and ground based aoe fire that moves across the room.\n\nSome people like to kill the adds then the boss, some people like to move the boss around the room killing one atro and damaging the boss at the same time over and over in a clock wise rotation (very good for groups with low damage). Others like to buff up with resists and heals while watching their feet.\n\nTo play it safe, make sure the tank range taunts them so that they hit the tank and not the group, and kill a couple to take some of the pressure off.\n\n|cffff00Flame Whip|r - The boss will throw out heavy attacks in the form of a flame whip. IF this hits a dps/healer they are dead whether the block or not. The tank should keep a taunt on the boss at all times so this ONLY hits the tank. The tank MUST block this, or they will take a one shot and die.\n\n|cffff00Spinning fire!!!|r - After two meteor phases the boss will teleport into the middle and create a massive aoe around the outside of the room. So no one can go around the room and must come in to the middle. During this the boss will create a tripod type aoe that will spin in a clock wise rotation.\n\nWhat you MUST do is find a safe spot and follow it around in a circle much like Molag Kena's spinning lightning. Once it is over carry on as normal.\n\nWatch your feet because other mechanics from Atronachs etc will still persist. If you can do rotations while moving in a circle then that is perfect, if not, just survive until it is over!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 TAMES-THE-BEAST |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is very simple but can be a complete mess. The boss will move around a LOT so this is a fairly mobile fight and there are adds coming in all of the time. Be sure to ALWAYS have the boss taunted and try to manipulate his position so that he is in the middle of the room as much as possible so you don't have to keep upsetting the netches. Regardless of what happens in the fight ALWAYS maintain a taunt.\n\nSpiders and Hackwings - The spawn through out the fight and if you do not deal with them you will end with loads of them! Be sure to kill the spiders FIRST, then the hackwings and THEN the boss. These are your PRIMARY targets, do NOT let them live.\n\n|cffff00BEES! (flies bugs whatever)|r - This mechanic is very similar to Siroria's mechanic in Cloudrest, in fact the second time we saw anything like this in the game. One person will be targeted with a swam of insects and 2-3 people must stack with them inside the swarm to spread the damage out between the group while keeping up the heals. The damage over time will then be split between the group and once it is over you can carry on as normal.\n\nBe warned, this can happen at some VERY uncomfortable times so be aware of surrounding mechanics and aoes, and if you have to move as a group, coordinate as such while staying in the circle. The circle is attached to ONE player.\n\n|cffff00Snipe|r - The boss will wind up a snipe with an orange glow usually aimed at whoever has agro(the tank). No matter what phase you are on in the fight you MUST interrupt this.\n\n|cffff00Troll|r - At 75% health the boss will spawn a troll in the room. It will require interrupts and also careful foot placement. The tank must keep this taunted at all times but also the group must be aware of his frontal cleave(triable aoe in front) so don't stand there, and also his ground slam. If he starts to slam the ground you must NOT stand near him. If you get caught by it, you will die! Kill the troll before proceeding with the boss.\n\n|cffff00Roots|r - The boss will occasionally cast a root on players where you will be unable to move. You must dodge roll or cleanse to get out of these else after a couple of seconds or so, they will crush you and you will die.\n\n|cffff00Haj Mota|r - At 60% health and under, a Haj Mota will spawn. These are HUGE, fast and annoying! The tank MUST turn this away from the group. It will help if you can keep this in the middle of the room so that you don't have to deal with too many Netchs. Also note that while the tank holds taunt they MUST still maintain a taunt on the boss.\n\nThe group should focus on killing the Haj Mota before then turning damage onto the boss again.\n\nThe Haj Mota will occasionally dive across the floor meaning repositioning is going to need to happen (careful here the next mechanic normally happens).\n\nFinally stay OUT of the frontal 180 field of view of the Haj Mota as dps and/or healers because he will duck his head in the ground and then come up rapidly with some fast moving aoes. If you avoid these you are fine, if not you are dead.\n\nALWAYS stay behind the target and as a tank NEVER spin this on the group.\n\n|cffff00Wamasu|r - Finally at around 35% a wamasu will spawn! THIS is now your primary focus. The safest way to deal with this is to actually stay spread out at range so you can SEE what the mechanics are as they can be quite random. The tank should hold it in the middle of the room if possible to prevent too much interaction with the Netchs and this should be killed rather than focusing on the boss.\n\nThe Wamasu must be turned away from the group and the groups hold always stay behind it or to it's side.\n\nIt has 3 basic mechanics. Firstly it will charge up a lightning breath at the tank in a coneal aoe, which needs to be blocked. Secondly it will turn and aim at random at a random player and fire a lightning ball directly at them (this is why you stay spread out so you can clearly see who the target is). If YOU are the target, simply dodge roll and you will 100% avoid it. Failing that block it but you will need heals.\n\nAnd his most dangerous mechanic is of course his burst mechanic. He will squat down wiggling and then burst with multiple aoes flying across the floor in all directions. THIS is why you stay ranged. Close range you wont see them and die instantly. Long range you can see them and find a gap to stand in so you don't get hit. This is a one shot for any dps and/or healer, so pay attention!\n\nNOTE: This boss is much easier to control if you put full focus on the adds NOT the boss and take your time. Once the wamasu is dead the only thing left is the boss excluding the spider and hack wing spawns.\n\nAlways focus the adds before the boss. Execute is very simple with no wamasu/troll/haj mota to deal with so is much more relaxed than most executes. Once the wamasu is down, relax and take your time!\n\n"

So be sure she is always turned away!\n\nThere are portals on the floor around the room which move, avoid these UNTIL you need them (explained below)\n\n|cffff00Portals|r - There are 3 portals surrounding the room. If you take them by accident OR to cleanse they will spawn 3x skeletons at random (sometimes melee sometimes ranged) these have low health but should be dealt with. Kill them quickly because their damage can be hard to deal with.\n\n|cffff00Tether|r - If the boss tethers a player she will be immune and you have a VERY short period of time to find a portal to stand in to cleanse it. If you don't get to a portal on the floor within around 3-5 seconds you will die! So be quick and get to one before you explode!\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This should only be on the tank so be careful not to drop taunt. You must block this heavy attack and be sure it is faced AWAY from the group else it will hit other players because it does have a small aoe, kind of like the Dawnbreaker like mechanic from Zaan. If this is on a dps however (aggro lost whatever) be sure to time it and dodge roll it, you won't block this as a dps.\n\n|cffff00BATS|r - The boss will spawn bats, pretty much like the vampire boss in VDSA and like the vampire ultimate. Get out of this as soon as possible to stop taking too much damage or else of course you will die. This doesn't last long but it hurts so you may want to move the boss.\n\n|cffff00Bone Colossus|r - Occasionally the boss will spawn a BONE colossus (this especially happens at low health also during execute). This is tethered to her and she will be immune while it is active. You MUST focus this target and kill it before you can hit her again. The tank needs to taunt this asap else it will heavy attack members of the group and kill them. Also note if you don't block this as a tank (the heavy attack) you will die. DPS/healers must dodge roll the heavy attack if it is on them because it hits WAY too hard for them to be able to block it.\n\n|cffff00Drain|r - This drain mechanic will stun the player and drain life from them. It is a very fast played ability that happens throughout the fight to random members of the group. You can break free from it but to stop her channeling you MUST interrupt her!\n\n|cffff00Infusers/adds|r - Under 35% she will spawn a bone collossus and 1x infuser and under 20% health she will spawn a wave of adds including 2x infusers, you MUST make sure these are interrupted at all costs. You can kill them and play it safe or go for the kill of the boss (depends on the group) but if you do NOT interrupt them when they channel...they will enrage everything in the room including the boss. Pay attention to interrupts and don't get execute panic. You can take as long as you need on this phase so long as it is controlled.\n\n"

The tank has a LOT to deal with in this round especially from the first add pull but of course priority targets are key. Deal with interrupts and adds as soon as possible and THEN deal with the boss. The tank should start by positioning in the middle of the room and be sure to never drop taunt from a single boss! All mechanics have been seen before by the group at this point so they should be familiar, however NOW you have to do multiple boss mechanics at once!\n\n|cffff00Battlemage Ennodius|r - The flame boss from round one appears and comes in with only 63% health. All mechanics apply for this boss from the FIRST section up above, be sure that you study these!\n\nAt 35% health the SECOND boss will spawn in the room!\n\n|cffff00Tames-The_Beast|r - You now have two bosses in the room, the first one and this one !! Kill the first boss and then you will be left with this one along rather than both.\n\nWhen this boss reaches 60% health (which is very early on since he comes in at 65%) he will spawn a wamasu! Be careful here remember how to kill it before, watch your feet (explained in the second boss section). Then at 50% he will spawn the LAST boss from round 3 (the vampire). Also note that at 35% he will spawn the Haj Mota so be very careful and keep this away turned away from the group (also explained above).\n\n|cffff00Lady Minara|r - This boss is very simple you know her from the last round. Stay out of bats, interrupt the drain and cleanse if you get tethered! Remember to watch your feet with the portals and kill the adds when they spawn. This fight doesn't have any infusers or extra jazz, just her basic mechanics as explained in arena 3 above.\n\nTIP!: Kill the flame boss first of course. Low health will spawn the archer but keep a taunt on him and ignore him until the flame boss is dead (that releases you of those mechanics).\n\nDO NOT push the archer, instead get the health to 50% (after the wamasu is dead) and the KILL the vampire. Killing the vampire leaves just YOU and the archer in the room. A Haj mota will spawn when he is low health but everything else is dead so it helps clear the room and now you have two choices, kill the haj mota then the boss. Or take the haj mota to the corner ignoring it turned away from the group while the boss gets killed on his own.\n\nTHIS way around the vampire doesn't spawn when the haj mota is in the room and it makes things a LOT less confusing!\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 DRAKEEH |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis is actually a VERY straight forward fight! The should be taunted at all times of course and can be held in any corner of the room (that's right not every fight has to be done in the MIDDLE). Doing so will make it easier for the tank to avoid the ghosts and hold the boss in a much better position without over confusing the issue.\n\nThe dps and healer should look at the 3 pads in the room and decide who is assigned to WHICH pad, and stick to that when it is important (explained below).\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - The boss has a very thin and wide cleave attack which should be blocked by the tank and faced away from the group. Pay close attention to this and make sure as a dps/healer you don't get caught by it.If you end up having it aimed in your direction, dodge roll.\n\n|cffff00Totem|r - Through out the fight there will be totems spawning in the room i one of the 4 corners. These MUST be focused. They fire off 3-4x rocks at the group which need to be blocked else you will be knocked down and stunned. Make sure someone is keeping an eye out for these and calling them out when they spwn so the dps can prioritize them.\n\n|cffff00Ghosts|r - The boss will put his hand in the air and put an aoe around all players. This is when some of the ghosts will have a yellow aura around them. The 3 pads that were assigned now need to be paid attention to. Each person should pick up 2-3 ghosts and deposit them or cleanse them in their own pad.\n\nSo go to YOUR side of the room, and do your part. If each player (not the tank) grabs two each and cleanses, the boss will create an explosion and all remaining ghosts will determine how much damage you will all take. If you dont get enough ghosts you will all die.\n\nNOTE: If you accidentally pick up normal ghosts before this phase don't pick up anymore than two. If not you can pick up 3. Too many ghosts - BOOM!\n\nIf successful you will all live and carry on fighting as normal.\n\n|cffff00Negate bubble|r - After the explosion of the ghost phase the boss will put a negate bubble where he stands.The tank will be the one caught in this based on the position, and should simple move the boss until the bubble is gone and then place him back in the corner again. Note the cleave will come shortly after this.\n\n|cffff00Magic Bomb|r - Just like the adds in the previous round (mages) the boss will channel an attack which will release a bomb into the air and onto the floor. This can be interrupted to be completely avoided.\n\n|cffff00Proxy shadows|r - The shadows will spawn at 60% health (2x shadows). They have low health and duplicate the boss's basic heavy attack and bomb mechanic. The tank should stack these on the boss and the group must be ready to interrupt them whenever they try to channel.\n\nFocus these adds at ALL times, unless you are killing a totem. This is not a dps race, but these must be focused no matter what so that it is much safer on the main boss.\n\n|cffff00Dragon Leap|r - The boss after 60% and when the shadows are in will do a Dragonleap or jump, into the air. When this happens he will choose a target at random and a big circle will appear where he is going to land. Simply move out of the circle and it wont get you.\n\nTIPS: Be sure to focus the totems at all times, focus the adds before the boss, assign dedicated pads and ghost areas and keep the boss faced in the corner for ease of positioning as much as possible. As explained in the video this is NOT a dps race, just prioritize mechanics. Apart from that , it is rinse repeat!\n\nGOOD LUCK!!!\n\n"

It isn't difficult to avoid, you don't need to sprint, just try not to stand still.\n\nHe has some very basic mechanics of which if you follow them you should not have too much trouble. He tends to spend more time casting than he does actually hitting you.\n\n|cffff00Root|r - The boss will cast a root ability about the same size as the wind flying around the arena on the floor. If you are caught in this you will of course be stuck to the ground and damaged. To avoid this simply move out of it when it is cast. Since you are avoiding the wind mechanic anyway (or should be) this should be an easy task. However people do get caught out so be careful and watch your feet.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - he boss will spawn adds during the fight.\n\nFirst he will spawn one, then two and then consistently Three, depending on how long you are in the fight for. Time he teleports to a new location he will spawn new adds.\n\nThese adds will hit fairly hard and fire out frontal AOEs so don't stand in front of them.\n\nAbove all the purpose of these adds is to distract you. IF you don't kill them, the next time the boss teleports, he will call them back and heal off of EACH add still left alive. So the trick is, the boss can take as long to kill as you like, but if you don't kill the adds, it will take you longer. Relax, kill the adds, THEN the boss.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00CENTURION CHAMPIONS|r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is a lot simpler than it looks. The main thing that kills people here is PANIC!\n\nRelax, keep eyes on the main mechanic you have been following all alongthe spinners! Keep an eye on their patterns and/or try to survive them as much as possible. There is NO race against time on this boss so if it takes you a long time, so be it.\n\nBasically they spawn one after another (3 in total). They have 'sit down' mechanics where they are invulnerable (explained below) and to start with, each Centurion that goes immune, spawns the next one until all 3 are in the room. However you only ever fight ONE at a time!\n\nThey will do different attacks and your window of opportunity to damage them is while they are INSIDE mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Swipe|r - IF you are close to a Centurion one of two major attacks they will do, one of them is a swipe which looks similar to a wound up heavy attack. Do not try to run away from this. BLOCK it. If you fail to block it you will take high damage. Combined with possible spinner bleeds, this could be a pain.\n\n|cffff00Steam|r - The second close combat ability they have is they will force steam out in front of them in a cone AOE. This can be completely avoided by simply stepping out of the damage area.\n\n|cffff00Lightning rain|r - IF you are a long way away from the Centurions they will fire multiple lightning blots into the air and they will rain down on the arena. THIS is the longest duration of any of the mechanics that the boss does.\n\nWhile this is happening, you have a window to do as much damage as possible because they will do NOTHING until this mechanic is over (they are exposed). Note however you must keep your feet moving to avoid the damage coming in at the same time of course as watching out for the spinners.\n\n|cffff00Sit Down|r - Depending on how fast you burn the bosses they will sit down, be immune and have a damage shield on them. You can do NO damage when this happens. When this happens you will ONLY be able to attack one.\n\nThis is the ultimate game of wack-a-mole. They will sit down around 75%, 50-55%, 35%, 25% and lower and just up down until they are dead.\n\nNotice however they have a lightning shield around them. Don't get too close because this WILL damage you.\n\nNOTE: You CAN burn these WAY before their thresholds however if you do so, once they have finished their mechanics, they will sit down anyway.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00LAMIA QUEEN|r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is a pain but not as difficult as you mite think on the surface. She can kill players very very fast but most of the time it is because people forget the mechanics already on going.\n\nYou have lightning coming from the sky, so you already know to keep moving to avoid this from the previous round.\n\nYou also have stranglers which of course should be your primary focus since they slow you down (slow down while trying to move, = lighting death of course).\n\nSomething that will help a LOT in this fight is the shield synergy buff. This will reflect back at the stranglers and save a lot of hassle.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - It is essential that you lessen the complications of the fight. The way to do this is to focus the adds. She will spawn adds at 75% 50% and 25% health. Keep your buffs up, (resistances and heals if you have them) and focus the adds each phase before going back to the boss.\n\nMost people die in here because they get overwhelmed with too much going on. So, get rid of the additional mechanics!\n\n|cffff00Scream|r - The main trick to this boss is to stay out of her face, and this is why.\n\nIf she screams she will stun you and you will take damage. But of course during this stun, everything else can hit you too. If you are stunned you must break free to get out.\n\nGenerally it is safer try to circle her all the time so i do not get caught out so much.\n\nIf you didn't kill those adds from the above mechanicsguess what is going to kill you while you are stunned?\n\nKeep it simple. Nuke it LATER when you get good at it. Remember there is NO rush, take your time with CLEAR mechanics.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00THE CONTROL GUARDIAN|r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis fight CANNOT be simpler. The boss has TWO major mechanics.\n\nMechanic 1 is: Moving around in a circle\n\nMechanic 2 is: Standing still!\n\n|cffff00Moving|r - While the boss is moving it will pump out HIGH shock damage around it and you will constantly take damage. To avoid this, stay UNDER the boss at ALL times while it is moving and you will take NO damage form it.\n\n|cffff00Stopped|r - GET OUT! When the boss stops, under it is NO longer safe so get away from the boss. It will constantly pump out fire damage under it.\n\nHowever at the same time, the boss will fire meteor type effects around the room aiming at YOU. You must avoid these by moving away from them before they land.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - When the boss is standing still, each time it does this you will get one Spider Dwemer and one Sphere Dwemer add. Be sure to draw these out and kill them to save complications.\n\n|cffff00Sentries|r - These will constantly spawn like the previous rounds, be sure to kill these asap, OR keep an eye on where they are since when they are enraged they will have a damage shield making them invulnerable and fire out nasty ground aoes.\n\nBasicallyWhen the boss is moving, stay under it. When the boss is standing still , stay away from it. That's it.\n\nDon't be afraid to take synergies that can help a LOT especially the healing chalice.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00MATRIARCH RUNA|r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis is the first major stopping point for anyone and almost everyone in VMA and this is because of one very simple reasonPACE!\n\nPeople try to nuke it and it is NOT that kind of fight. This fight has a completely different condition in order to be clean. Do NOT over burn the boss. If you do, you will be overwhelmed with more adds than your survival will allow.\n\n|cffff00Trolls|r - Rule number one. Interrupt the troll, no matter where it is, and kill it. If the troll smashes ONE platform, it is game over.\n\nThey will spawn all throughout the fight, pay attention to them. They spawn from the middle but can go anywhere they like.\n\n|cffff00Fear|r - Occasionally the boss will fear you trying to push you into the ice (damage over time in the ice) be sure to break free from this as soon as you can.\n\n|cffff00Slam|r - The boss will cause a HUGE aoe slam to knock you back and do large damage. Be sure to avoid this but if you get caught at least block.\n\n|cffff00Swipe|r - The boss will swipe in causing you to be knocked back so avoid/block this.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - The boss has a nasty frontal cleave which makes the ground raise up, basically causing frontal aoe damage with rocks flying across the floor. Stay out of this or block it. The trick really is to staying on the boss's back if you can help it. Circling helps sometimes but remember the rest of the mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - Once the boss starts taking damage shortly after (around 80%, 60% and 40% ISH, depending on your burn) the boss will spawn TWO adds (note one does come with a pet wolf too).\n\nAt all costs the adds MUST take damage before you push the boss to the jump phase.\n\nALWAYS kill the adds and get damage off the boss as much as possible to be sure the room is clear. Failure to do this will cause overlap of mechanics and you could end up with up to 6 + adds in the room if you go to Yolo!\n\nTwo handers heavy attack so be sure to block (they turn into werewolves too and eat corpses to heal so kill them fast)\n\nArchers have a spray attack.\n\nIce mages MUST be focused they hit incredibly hard.\n\n|cffff00JUMP!|r -THIS is important. At 75% and 50% the boss will glow red, enrage and JUMP on whichever platform she is standing on and smash it to bits.\n\nOnce it is gone it is gone! This is your queue to get out of the way and find a safe place. If she lands on you or you are on the pad that explodes, you are dead.\n\nOnce it is gone, a Nerid/Leminid will spawn with HIGH ice damage and she must be killed. Remember, in this fight, adds must die first!\n\nTIPS/Strategy!: Start on the platform with the speed buff and face the center of the map. The boss spawns there.\n\nLook to your right and THAT is where the two adds will spawn. So gently attack the boss to push for the spawn and then take all damage off the boss and kill the adds.\n\nonce they are down, push the boss (no ultimates)\n\nWhen the boss is ready to jump, (take the speed synergy if you wish) run to the platform with the healing chalice (take this too if you wish for survival).\n\nFace the boss, and kill the incoming Nerid.\n\nNote your location, your RIGHT hand side behind you almost, is where the NEXT two adds will spawn.\n\nPush the boss a little until they spawn then get all damage OFF the boss and ON to the adds. DO NOT push the boss until ALL adds are dead (no ulitmates). Once they are dead, push the boss to jump.\n\nWhen she jumps run to the last pad. Pick up both synergies (shield and damage).\n\nNOW you can drop the house on the boss. BUT if you have low damage, kill the adds first THEN kill the boss.\n\nIf you have extremely low damage the boss will jump a final time and kill you but that is only if you have like 1k dps or make a lot of mistakes. It is very rare for it to happen with the current state of the game regardless of experience.\n\nRelax, pace it, adds first, boss last.\n\nFinal note: ALWAYS deal with that troll. No matter what is happening.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00CHAMPION OF ATROCITY|r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is simple but hectic at the same time. She hits very hard and there can appear to be a lot going on.\n\nRemember from the previous round with the lightning coming down, the hoavars and the spiders coming, you have to keep moving and pay attention to those totems.\n\nLike the last boss however, there is a simple condition. Kill ALL adds. Anything that is NOT the boss, has no business being there, so kill it.\n\nAlso remember, if you uncover all of the totems, you WILL stun her.\n\n|cffff00Lightning blast|r - The boss will channel/cast a spell and if you do not interrupt her she will emit a frontal lighting rage type ability which does HIGH damage. Be sure to interrupt this.\n\n|cffff00Spider Minion|r - As the fight unfolds she will spawn a small minion that looks just like her. This has similar abilities and they are linked together. Basically while this add is alive the boss takes MUCH less damage and grows in strength. You must kill this add at all costs.\n\nMechanics can overlap but generally this spawns around the 70-75% health area and again at 50% and under. Pay attention to what is going on and don't let these live.\n\n|cffff00Lucher|r - Midway through the fight a lurcher will spawn. These are the same as the enemies from the last round, you may want to hit this guy with an ultimate to get rid of him fast. He is not so bad on his own but with the boss in the room the additional damage is not something you want to have to defend against. So get rid of it quick, and be sure to interrupt it if he starts shaking.\n\n|cffff00Blast!|r - The boss will occasionally emit a large aoe from her center, be sure to get away from this. When it peaks it will explode and knock you back.\n\nSpit - This is consistent through out the fight. The boss will spit a ball of poison at you which hits pretty hard to start with but the long the fight goes on the tougher it gets especially if she is enraged/low health. You can dodge this if you see it coming. However if you have low damage and you feel the fight is just getting too tough, take the reflection shield synergy and it will throw it back at her.\n\n|cffff00TIPS:|r - Essentially this is NOT a DPS race as such BUT the longer the fight the tougher she gets both in damage output and mitigation so focus as much as you can on keeping the mechanics clean.\n\nDON'T leave the spiders alive for her to grow in strength, don't forget the hoarvars for the totem stun and don't forget the sneaky spiders that cover them up.\n\nSpeed buffs and healing buffs from synergies help a lot but pace them.\n\n"

The boss is not really the difficulty part but RNG is instead. The musrooms CAN spawn where you do not want them to and there is nothing you can do about it. However rather than dwelling on that the mechanics and tips will be explained.\n\nYou can stay as close to the boss as you like so long as you know the mechanics, failing that you can play ranged and it is also just fine to do that so long as you know what to avoid and block.\n\nYou really don't need to run around, in fact if you do, you are likely to run into poison, so relax.\n\n|cffff00Bite|r - The boss will bite you stunning you and applying a bleed. You must break free from this and out heal the damage over time. This CAN be blocked but every time you block it he will quickly try again, so sometimes, sucking it up can save you a lot of blocking resources, but the choice is yours there.\n\n|cffff00Slap|r - The boss does a few light slap attacks, these can be blocked\n\n|cffff00Spit|r - f you are at range, the boss will spit in the air and put a small aoe on the ground, simply avoid this by walking out of it when it lands.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - if the boss stomps, you really want to block this. He will make rocks fly out in all directions and has a small knock back. At range you can stand between these hits and completely avoid them but up close you must block.\n\n|cffff00Lightning mages/scream|r - After under 20seconds the boss will spawn two lightning mages. These will hit you with ranged damage and sometimes teleport to you and explode in lightning damage. kill ONE of these, NOT both.\n\nAs soon as ONE is dead, the boss will enrage and scream doing massive damage through out the entire room.\n\nThe ONLY ways to survive, is to stay in the protective bubble the lighting mage puts himself inOR interrupt the boss (Warning do not do this, stay in the bubble).\n\nWhile inside the bubble you are safe so long as the add stays alive. Once the screaming is over, kill the add and go back to hitting the boss.\n\nThis mechanic will repeat as many times as you like until the boss is dead.\n\nSokill one add, hide near the other, kill the add when it is safe, rinse repeat. That's it.\n\nHowever, if you accidentally, OR purposely interrupt the boss, he will stop screaming, and STAY enraged! doing massive damage. So don't let him touch you with anything, especially the stomp.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Remember the Venom callers MUST die. And also mushrooms will explode and put a dot on you which you MUST cleanse if you get caught via the green pools.\n\nIf you are in the bubble, safe, and a mushroom spawns under you, very few survive thisRIP.\n\n"

Mainly meaning 'adds first!'. ANY adds in the room must be killed. And also, keep your distance and half the mechanics won't affect you.\n\n|cffff00Totems|r - There are 3 totems in the room. Each one needs to be killed in order to weaken the boss. Once they are down, the boss will be stunned and exposed and this is where you attack.\n\nYES you can kill this in one go if you have lots of damage, but if not, you will have to follow the rest of the mechanics and do multiple laps.\n\n|cffff00Flame Shaper|r - These will spawn through out the fight, depending on how fast you are, usually around the second/3rd totem death. These are your primary target. If they put their staff in the air and start channeling their fire attack, and they are NOT interrupted. You are going to die. Interrupt them and kill them ALWAYS as a priority.\n\n|cffff00Flame Atronachs|r - Usually on the second lap (not shown in the video) the boss can spawn two flame atronachs. These are not a huge threat but to save complications, be sure to kill them so you are not taking additional damage where you don't want to.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - If the boss gets close to you he will cleave you with his sword and knock you back. try not to get close to him.between a wipe and a pass because if people die this is VERY hard to recovery from.\n\n|cffff00Fireball|r - The boss will occasionally breathe a fire ball at you, this can be blocked, or dodge rolled and doesn't do too much damage. Just keep your resists/heals up.\n\n|cffff00Chain|r - If the boss is still alive by a 3rd lap of the totems, he will gain a new ability and be able to chain you in (like the previous mini boss). This is normally used in combination with a follow up cleave.\n\n|cffff00Explosion!!!|r - If the is STILL alive as long as a 4th lap, he gets what looks like an ultimate. He can explode and cause a HUGE spreading fire mechanic.\n\nThere are gaps in this so you can survive if but the trick is, if you see him channeling it, get as far away as possible in order be in a safer position to find a gap. (close is clustered, long range it spreads with bigger gaps).\n\nTIP: Always kill adds, be sure to kill the adds before the final totem or even force them to spawn so you get as much time on the boss as possible.\n\nAnd finally, stay away from the boss at all times unless you are killing him. Speed buff and reflective shield synergy helps a lot!\n\n"

DON'T PANIC!\n\nThis boss has a LOT going on, so you will need to absorb these mechanics step by step, there is NO rush, this is NOT a DPS race.\n\nThe boss has 3 major phases and each one must be paid close attention to.\n\nBut of course you must understand his mechanics in order to successfully follow through with the fight.\n\n|cffff00Skull throw|r - The boss puts his hands together or casts a winding up ability with his staff. When this happens he is going to fire a Skull at you which will do HUGE damage and knock you down and back! This can be BLOCKED or DODGED. (This mechanic is crucial).\n\n|cffff00Burst|r - The boss will crouch and channel an ability with a spreading aoe under him, when this peaks it will explode and knock you back. Do not get caught in this.\n\n|cffff00Skull channel!|r - The raise his staff in the air and hit you rapidly with multiple skull like attacks over and over and over. THIS is simple. Interrupt it (or take the shield synergy and reflect it). Failure to do so will kill you.\n\n|cffff00Teleport|r - The boss Teleport regularly normally after about 20seconds in his current position. So plan your burst. If you throw down all of your damage as he is about to move, that's a waste. So keep eyes on him.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - The boss has 2 basic adds, one is a healer (which should be killed or it will heal things and hit you with fire damage) and a slow walking add from two rounds previous. These must be killed. The slow walking add is intending on releasing a Bone Colossus into the fight. Do not let that happen.\n\n|cffff00JEFF!!|r - The boss will spawn a deadroth aka Jeff into the room and this guy MUST die. Kill Jeff no matter what, no excuses, he MUST die. If he bursts into flame and breaths on you, you will have a fire damage over time ability stuck to you. Running won't save you. As long as Jeff is alive, you will ALWAYS take damage and you will die. Kill him, he is more important than the boss!\n\nAnd now to explain how to tactically manage this fight phase by phase.\n\n|cffff00PHASE ONE:|r - The boss starts in the middle of the room and it is just you and him.  So this is your opportunity to get some damage in on him.\n\nhe will hit you with some basic attacks and then a skull attack (explained above). This should be blocked or dodged. If he has not hit 75% health or lower he will teleport. to a random location.\n\nOnce he teleports he will start his Skull channel ability. You have two choices here. interrupt him, or take the shield synergy buff and just let it reflect on him while you kill the healer.\n\nIF you let it run it's course you will have time reflecting damage with the buff to kill the healer BUT if you interrupt the boss (or let it run out) the first JEFF will spawn!\n\nThe boss will teleport and continue with his basic attacks, skull, blast etc. This phase you MUST kill JEFF.\n\nOnce Jeff and the healer is down (healer is optional but makes sense). continue with the boss. Once he finally does hit 75% or lower he will go up into the air and be immune (he has gone upstairs).\n\nTo get upstairs you need to look for ONE of THREE pads on the floor. This will be lit up.\n\nYou must go over to it and kill the clan fear NEAR it. In order to activate it. Once this is done you can use it as a teleport to upstairs.\n\nWarning: During this phase there are lich crystals you must avoid, and if Jeff is alive you must NOT go upstairs. His dot will go with you.\n\n|cffff00PHASE TWO:|r - Upstairs is simple.\n\nThere are 3 crystals. They must die.\n\nMeteors will constantly be falling so do NOT stand still, these must be avoided. Or you will be stunned and killed.\n\nThe boss will put his hands together and fire a skull at you which must be dodged or blocked (demonstrated in the video). So try to keep eyes on him until you have it embedded in your mind as a mental timer.\n\nAfter the skull he will cast a protection wall which is rotating around the platform. You must get behind it and follow it. It will explode and you will be protected, but if you arenot behind it the explosion will push you off and you will have to make your way back upstairs.\n\nNOW, this process will repeat but now he throws TWO skulls before the wall phase.\n\nSo, avoid two skulls, while avoiding meteors, and killing crystals and then hide behind the wall again. This needs to be repeated until all crystals are dead.\n\nTIP: If you are upstairs for more than 3 laps, jump off, kill the new Jeff, and come back up.\n\nYou are constantly taking damage over time and each lap increases the damage and the speed of the protection wall.\n\nOnce all three Crystals are dead, the boss will explode and you will be thrown off, and it is back to downstairs for the final battle.\n\nPHASE 3 The Final Fight - The boss now has all his basic mechanics, take a breath\n\nInterrupt his channeling, avoid his aoe, and dodge/block the skull. Relax and keep consistent damage on him. This is NOT a DPS race.\n\nWhile you are down stairs there are two adds, the healer and the walking 'I'm going to spawn a huge bone colossus' enemy. Adds must die. Don't worry about the boss. Kill the adds, and avoid boss attacks. Take your time and relax.\n\nDuring the fight the gold ghosts are now present. Pick up 3 and you can stun him just like other rounds but be sure he does NOT take them because if he gets 3 he will explode and you will die.\n\nEvery 3rd gold ghost, Jeff will spawn and he is 100% your priority now. KILL that Deadroth or else.\n\nTHIS whole thing now just needs to be repeated.\n\nSoto keep it simple.\n\nInterrupt and avoid boss hits, while keeping damage up as and when (no rush). Kill all adds, pick up all ghosts. Kill Jeff.\n\nRepeat repeat repeat until it is over.\n\nNo rush, no panic, no yolo. FORCE clean mechanics and you WILL do it.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n"

Although it is only the first boss it does teach you some heavy lessons early on, introducing one of the most important mechanics for the whole dungeon as well as reminding you of some familiar mechanics if you ever did Aetherian Archive Or Ruins Of Mazzatun. This boss is quite mobile occasionally and the tank will have to keep it turned away from the boss as much as possible so that it's default movement mechanic can be controlled. OR people will just have to watch their feet!\n\n|cffff00Ground stomp|r - The boss will continuously bang on the ground causing aoe damage. The damage is not that high and the tank is only really the one at threat here but keep up damage as and when as dps and make sure the heals stay consistent while this is happening.\n\n|cffff00Rock throw/Sit Down|r - The boss will become immune and every second throw rocks at the group. These rocks are the same as the mechanic in Aetherian Archive and Ruins Of Mazzatun where you basically must BLOCK to avoid being knocked down and taking HUGE damage.\n\nThere are two ways to break this. You can either heal like hell and let it run it's course. OR you can go over to the yellow pads, synergies them and then heavy attack the red orbs that come out in the direction of the boss to remove the shield.\n\nIf done correctly he will stand up again and the fight will continue.\n\n|cffff00Warning:|r taking the synergy removes 50% of your health so be sure you are not low health at the time! Taking the synergy AND getting hit with the rock will kill you.\n\n|cffff00Rock Slide (choo choo!)|r - After standing up the boss will face in the direction he is agroed towards and basically steam train in a straight line across the room. If you get caught in this you will be run over and killed. Stay out of the path of the boss.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - After and around the invulnerability phases the room will fill up with adds. You should make it your priority to deal with these fast so you do not get overwhelmed by them. Some will require interrupts and some avoiding aoes, but be sure as the tank you stack them up, and as dps and healers you do NOT run around the room in circles. Pace yourself and manage them.\n\n"

These adds will explode when the orb is exposed as they sacrifice themselves (in the video they were bugged and stuck in the door). When the Orbs are exposed the boss will try to channel from them. You MUST heavy attack the orb and get rid of it. If you do not do it in time the room will explode in massive damage and you will wipe.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - The boss has a heavy attack and cleave mechanic and you MUST block this as the tank, a dps will die to it so be careful. Do not make the boss face the group at any time because this will cause massive problems trying to find room to resurrect people it kills.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - During the fight lots of basic trash adds will come into the room. The tank should try to stack these on the boss if possible and if your group dps is relatively low you should probably try to focus them over the boss. The ranged targets will require interrupts when they channel so be careful not to get stuck in the aoes they fire if you miss the interrupts.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - Blood Puddle is much like the one in Spindleclutch II. The boss will transform into a puddle on the ground and follow the person whom last had agro (should be the tank) simply stand still and block this. the damage the puddle does will heal the boss, and while blocking the damage he can do is much less hence the heal being not so strong. This only lasts a few seconds but be careful as he usually comes out of it with a heavy attack.\n\n|cffff00Shield|r - This is just like the shield on the first boss in Maw Of Lorkhaj, at 90% ,60%, and 30% health, he will raise his hands and a shield will be spinning around him. The only way to remove it, is to kill it. During this phase the group will take damage every tick getting more aggressive until it peaks then will continuously do damage to each player. Each player has their own aoe and you must NOT overlap else they will of course do damage to more than one player at a time (each has their own, overlap increases damage, pretty simple).\n\nThe trick to this is to simply circle the boss formation wise, while the healer keeps healing and the group does as much damage as possible. Once the shield is removed, the fight continues as normal.\n\n|cffff00NOTE:|r this shield has a health amount, your dps doesn't have to be HIGH but if you are going to take a long time, your healer will need to work hard to keep you up. So the faster the better (video of me killing it with a tank! lol ).\n\n"

This boss is really made to look a lot more complex than it actually is. Good discipline really fixes all the problems that are common for pugs in here. Tank tanks, dps does damage and healer heals! Sounds simple enough? You would think...\n\nThe tank should turn the boss away from the group facing the stairs and NEVER turn him around. Always face away from the group.\n\nThe dps should claim the left side and right side (one each) as theirs while the healer claims the middle formation wise for the eruptions. Decide who is going where before you pull the boss.\n\n|cffff00Eruptions|r - The boss will slam the ground and ALL damage he takes will reflect and hit the group and he will also be immune. This phase lasts 20seconds.\n\nThis happens at 90% 70% 50% and 30% but also if you are slow with the damage he will just do it every 30seconds.\n\nWhile this is happening geysers will open up and lava will fly out of them hitting the group repeatedly until 20seonds is over or everyone is dead.\n\nThe way to STOP this happening is to make your dps players, left and right, attack the blocks to cover up the lava spurts. Once they are covered the gargoyle will be no longer immune! During this phase the healer should focus PURELY on keeping the dps alive while they are doing their job. Pretty simple but SO easy to mess up. Focus.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - The boss spawns a HUGE amount of adds in the room, these root, channel abilities, have lots of aoe and every side of nasty you can imagine in an add pull. This happens each phase that he is causing the eruptions. The tank should pull these as close to the boss as possible and CC them while the group is managing with the geysers. Once they have successfully passed that phase, the group should focus fully on the adds else the overlap of mechanic will flood the room with way too many to manage.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The simplest mechanic in the game for a tank to put into practiceThis heavy attack requires you to BLOCK. If you do not block you are you take huge damage. A dps however will have to dodge roll else it will kill them.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - The boss will occasionally hit with cleave like attacks and the group MUST NOT be in the bosses face. This is for the tank to suck up. If dps/healers get hit this will most likely kill them. The group needs to stay behind the boss at all times.\n\n"

There are many mechanics that should already be familiar if you have gotten this far but it is very important that you pay attention to them. Also it is a very mobile fight. The tank should TRY to stack the melee on top of the ranged boss to keep things simple and damage can be then distributed to both bosses evenly, but if this is not possible just be sure that you have BOTH taunted at all times just in case. Above all if you had to chose a target individually. FOCUS Nisaazda as much as possible. Once she is down it is pretty easy.\n\n|cffff00Fus Ro DAH!|r - Grundwulf will shout Fus Ro DAH! and shout in a straight line doing huge damage to anyone caught inside of it. This is very easy to see. Simply don't stand in it but if you get caught, be sure to block.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - Grundwulf will heavy attack whoever has aggro (should be the tank) Block this attack or you will die. If you are a dps or healer however you need to dodge roll it on time as you will not survive blocking it.\n\n|cffff00Teleport|r - Nisaazda does NOT stand still. She will teleport from one side of the room to the other, keep track of her at all times. Usually after a teleport, mechanics follow because you are so far away!\n\n|cffff00Channeled attacks|r - Nisaazda will cast channeled attacks that will fire rapid shots at the group which MUST be interrupted.\n\n|cffff00Ghosts|r - hosts should be taunted by the tank and they can ONLY be killed if someone hits them with a red Hemoglobin Orb. They are invulnerable if they are not debuffed by the red orb.\n\n|cffff00Blood circle|r - During the fight a MASSIVE red circle of blood will be cast into the room. Stay out of this at all costs and keep the BOSS out of it. If you touch it you will take huge damage, and if the boss touches it they will DEAL large damage (enrage).\n\n|cffff00Gargoyle|r - Nisaazda will try to do a completely different type of channeling which cannot be interrupted by the regular 'interrupt' type movements/abilities. Instead you MUST hit her with the red Hemoglobin orb and stop her doing it. If you do not, you will make her spawn a rather large gargoyle. If this happens the tank must taunt it fast and you need to focus it down. If this runs loose it will melt through players!\n\n|cffff00TIP:|r Keep the bosses close, stay on interrupts, hit the red orb often and kill Nisaazda fast so the fight gets much less complicated sooner.\n\n"

NOPE!\n\nYou are here to fight someone who is KILLING one, siphoning power from a dragon has made Grundwulf MUCH stronger! This Hard mode is not as bad as it first looks on the surface but will take a bit of practice to understand what is going on.\n\nThe tank should taunt the boss and keep him as central as possible to keep things simple. ALWAYS face the boss away from the group. The mechanics are pretty much rinse repeat but they do get a lot heavier when health goes lower. So focus is key.\n\nThe healer should stay close to the tank but behind the boss (depending on mechanics) and the dps will need to decide who is going to get the Hemoglobin orb and when. Everyone trying to do the same job will mess it up.\n\n|cffff00Fus Ro Dah|r - The boss will shout Fus Ro Dah! in a straight line. Anyone caught by this not blocking (apart from tank) is dead. so do NOT stand in this (known bug: sometimes it hits people anyway, make it a habit to block even if you are OUT of it).\n\nOnce the shout is over 3 circles will be on the ground and a ghost will come out of each one. These are immune to damage and the tank should position them all on the boss.\n\n|cffff00NOTE:|r These can be made vulnerable by hitting the Hemoglobin orb, BUT hold back for now).\n\n|cffff00Giant bat!! (hard mode)|r - The boss will cast at a player aiming his hand at their feet and a small aoe notification will spawn under a random player (not the tank). Whoever has this needs to run NOW! However, do not panic. A giant bat will spawn and one shot you but if you simply run in a circle around the tank (without getting too close to the boss) the bat will just follow you round and round.\n\nWe stay close to the tank so that the bat is close to the ghosts (the bat is also immune).\n\nNow that you have the ghosts AND the bat in the room, send one player to go and hit the Hemoglobin synergy and heavy attack the orb!\n\nIf done correctly, the bat and all of the ghosts will be vulnerable, the bat will die instantly and the ghosts will start to take damage from anything already running.\n\n|cffff00Hoavar!|r - When you heavy attack the red Hemoglobin orb, a hoavar will spawn and follow a player debuffing/cursing them with a horrible effect that will look like an empty health bar with a damage shield on it.\n\nYou must now heal to FULL to remove it, or die. much like in Cloudrest. Stay out of the hoarvar's face and kill it asap. The trick of course is to let it run into the group while you have damage running on the boss and it can die to passive damage but i would suggest focusing it.\n\nThis is your priority target ANY time you hit that red orb!\n\n|cffff00Shackle|r - To start with ONE player will be chosen at random and a spike will appear out of the ground with a red chain attached to the chosen player. This shackles them to it and consistently causes them to take damage while spawning a coagulant (small add).\n\nThe player affected must get to the spike as fast as possible. Wile not inside the circle around the spike you cannot be healed! Stay with the spike until it is gone and you are no longer shackled.\n\nDuring the fight these will become more of a problem where co-ordination and attention being paid are both important. The longer the fight (or less health the boss has) the more of these will spawn, first one then 2 then 3 then eventually 4. At low health there will be ONE shackle mechanic for EACH player, resulting in all 4 of you having to get to your locations fast AND having 4x coagulants.\n\nSo it is key you get to your locations and also key you regroup back in the middle and kill the coagulants.\n\n|cffff00Fire circles|r - The boss will cast multiple circles of fire under players so be careful not to run around too much, the more you run the more scattered these will be. These don't do MASSIVE damage, but you want to try to find gaps in these if you can.\n\n|cffff00Dragon Fire|r - The boss will hide behind the block in the middle of the room and the dragon will try to breath in his face. when this happens, get OUT of the fire and attack the block to move it out of the way (i would recommend a heavy attack as you can only hit it ONCE).\n\nIf you fail this mechanics the fire will spread the damage throughout the room and you will all die.\n\n|cffff00Block throw|r - The boss will throw the block in the air to reposition it, if it lands on you, you are dead so be careful to watch for where it lands.\n\n|cffff00Dire-Maw Adds|r - These adds spawn at health percentages and should be dealt with as fast as possible, i would recommend saving ultiamtes for these. The tank must taunt them asap and turn them away from the group.\n\nThey spawn at around 70% 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%.\n\n|cffff00TIPS:|r Keep the ghosts invulnerable until the bat comes out and red orb them all at once together. Always bring the hoavar and coagulant's into the group. And save ultimates for the adds. There is NO execute mechanic, no enrage just rinse repeat.\n\nClean focus and co-ordination will get the job done. GOOD LUCK!!\n\n"

It can be very straight forward but also because of some popular mistakes, this can be a bit of a pug killer early on. The tank should hold the boss in the middle of the room and turn it away from the group at ALL times.\n\n|cffff00THE BEAR!|r\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will fire off nasty heavy attacks which must be blocked by the tank, if the tank fails to block they will take MASSIVE damage. If for any reason the boss attacks a dps/healer they must dodge roll. Block won't be enough to survive.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - This mechanic is pretty simple. The boss will hit in frontal area of affect. Be sure that the dps and healers are not inside of this and the tank if inside of it blocks. Pretty basic stuff.\n\n|cffff00THE SPIDER!|r\n\nOnce the bear is dead the spider will spawn, during this spawning the spider can chose to heavy attack ANYONE and it is very hard for any tank to taunt it initially. So EVERYONE, must STAND BACK as soon as that bear dies and let the tank grab the new boss. Failure to do so will almost definitely kill someone!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This mechanic is simpleAs the tank, block it or die. As a dps/healer, dodge roll it or die.\n\nThis should only EVER be on the tank but it is very strong, no dps/healer will survive blocking this mechanic so pay close attention.\n\n|cffff00Spiders|r - Throughout the fight this boss will spawn small spiders. These should be chained in and held on the boss so they can be killed in aoe by the dps. If the dps in the group is low, then you should FOCUS these spiders asap. The longer the fight goes on the more of these will spawn and you will get overwhelmed.\n\n|cffff00SELENE|r\n\n|cffff00Poison|r - This mechanic was used in Asylum Sanatorium. Whoever has this cone affect on them will take poison damage during the duration. It will follow the targeted player around so do NOT move. Simply stay inside of it while healing or hold block. Running around will make this hit other players. All other players should stay out of it. It only lasts for a short period of time so do NOT panic and run around the room. Hold your ground.\n\n|cffff00POP!|r - The boss will cast aoes under each player in the room and as they grow they will POP and throw players into the air. These can be stepped out of to completely avoid them, however if you are not fast enough at least BLOCK to mitigate some of the impact. You will be stunned/thrown back so you will need to break free.\n\n|cffff00Channel|r - This mechanic is the pug killer. Selene will teleport all over the room during the fight and you MUST above ALL, keep eyes on her! At any time she could use her channeling ability which will rapidly tick projectile damage at all players. You must interrupt her as fast as possible to stop her doing this. If you do not, people WILL die. If you are running to her rather than using an interrupt skill, i recommend dodge rolling along the way, because you CAN dodge ticks of it. This is a KEY mechanic, no interrupt will result in a wipe 9 times out of 10.\n\n"

Key to this is to NOT panic and for the tank to remain in control at all times. Do not run around the room. It is much easier if you simply plant your feet and keep the boss as still as possible and only move where necessary. Many people make mistakes here moving the boss all the time to avoid things. You simply don't need to.\n\nYou will have to take the boss from 100% to 0 3 times. Once this is done the fight is over. Each phase takes more damage off of Maarselok (The dragon gets damaged throughout the dungeon).\n\n|cffff00Breath|r - Maarselok will charge across the room in the air breathing in a HUGE strip aoe. This is about as self explanatory as it getsstay, out, of, IT!\n\nDo not let the boss touch this aoe, else it will get stronger (enraged boss hits harder). However as you can see in the video we position the boss in such a manner that the breath doesn't go anywhere near it. Easy Peasy right?\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss heavy attack in the direction of whoever has aggro (should be the tank) Simply BLOCK this. Note: if enraged it will hit harder so be careful and keep your health up. DPS won't be able to block this but they can dodge it.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - There are several adds to deal with, skeletal dogs, imps, stranglers and srpiggans. The tank should chain these in and control them while maintaining a taunt on the boss.\n\nThey must die or you will be overwhelmed by them. If the boss is currently in 0% health there are certain adds that MUST die before he comes back out of his immune phase again (imps are exempt from this).\n\nSome adds will require interrupting but above all, don't panic. They don't have a huge amount of health, just keep up your heals, and aoe damage and these shouldn't be a problem. However if your group has low damage, don't worry, simply focus them one at a time until they are all gone and then go back to the boss. Technically you can take as long as you like on the boss so long as it is controlled. Work to your group's strengths.\n\n|cffff00DRAIN!|r - This mechanic is simple but looks scary. The boss will attach negative aoes to members of the group and they will be dropped under their feet, sometimes one, sometimes up to 3x each, depending on how the boss is feeling. Once these are dropped on the ground they will remain there for a time. They will deal moderate damage but above all, they will drain the hell out of your resources and your stamina pool simply will NOT last.\n\nThis is simple. Don't stand in them! Find a gap, and place your feet where you are not in danger. Don't panic.\n\nTIP: running around like a headless chicken in THIS fight will be a wipe. Relax, watch your feet and follow the mechanics and you will be fine no matter how much damage your group does or does not have.\n\n"

Technically there is no execute phase and/or RACE as such, but of course the more FOCUSED your damage is, the easier this can become. A lot of which is actually due to POSITIONING rather than tank and spank. The tank will need to me pretty mobile in this fight, fully understand the mechanics and NEVER drop a taunt. Dropping taunt in THIS fight is a wipe, it is VERY hard to recover.\n\nThe tank should always tank the add AWAY from the blue circle of death, and players must stay out of it until it is gone. This is your first rule. DON'T stand in stupid !\n\n|cffff00Lurcher|r - The Lurcher is the main mechanical add for the fight. You MUST kill it in order to progress to the next phase.\n\nThe tank should always turn this away from the group and NEVER drop the taunt.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - The Lucher will hit the tank with extremely strong heavy attacks. These must be blocked. A dps will have to dodge roll but really should not be in front of the boss anyway. Watch your feet.\n\n|cffff00Lurcher|r - The Lurcher will occasionally cast a cleave type attack throwing rocks across the floor much like the Hag Raven boss in Bloodroot Forge. This should be directed at whoever has aggro. If this is aimed at the tank, they simply should block and/or stand out of it. If it is a dps or a healer in the way of this, they need to get out of it asap.\n\nIt is a small aoe cone so easy to see and avoid.\n\n|cffff00Light Attacks/curse|r - Light attacks, seem to be pretty basic, but they can get really strong from this particular target. Be sure to be blocking these as they do a lot more damage than you would expect and can apply a curse (damage over time). While these light attacks appear to be melee, you CAN cast 'absorb' type abilities to mitigate and/or heal from them depending on skill used.\n\n|cffff00Flies|r - The tree will fire spurting spray type abilities in the form of single splashing flies type effect aoes on the ground at the group. Be sure to avoid these. They do a substantial amount of damage.\n\n|cffff00STOMP!!!|r - This mechanic is the most essential in the fight. The Lurcher will stompThis has a large fast spreading aoe that can and MUST be avoided. You can block it, step out of it or dodge roll it.\n\nHowever most important of all, once it is finished the size of the stomp aoe will remain on the ground with a big dark blue circle. This will stay on the floor until the Lurcher is dead. Standing in this will kill you because you will take high damage over time. And every stomp will place ANOTHER circle on the ground.\n\nSo, this is where the tank comes in. Every time the Lurcher stomps, the tank should move the add out of the circle into a safe space.\n\nSimply put, the boss needs to be slowly kited around the room in a direction the group decides.\n\n|cffff00Seed|r - When the Lurcher dies, it will drop a seed on the ground and INSTANTLY another Lurcher will spawn. This Lurcher MUST be grabbed instantly by the tank. Upon entering the room the first thing that add tries to do is heavy attack someone! Grab it quick!\n\nA player in the group must pick up the seed via a synergy... THEN stand IN the big blue circle of death surrounding the tree, and synergize again to throw it AT the tree.\n\nThis will break the shield, remove the circle, and for around 20 seconds you will be able to damage the tree. Once 20seconds is up you will have to get out of the circle and go back to killing the new Lurcher and repeat the process over and over until the tree is dead.\n\nTIPS: Save your ultimate for THIS phase.\n\nThe tank should also taunt the tree for a debuff AND bring the new Lurcher CLOSE to the tree, so that during this phase the add takes extra aoe damage.\n\nThis is for efficiency so that once the circle appears again, when fighting the new Lurcher, it already has less health making the next phase shorter.\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - This is the pug killing part. After the first phase when the tree has gone immune again. Stranglers will spawn around the room. The longer the fight, the more stranglers you will get. These deal MASSIVE projectile damage from huge range.\n\nThis fight is NOT technically a dps race, BUT the condition is, the longer the fight, the more stranglers. SO, you MAY have to send someone to focus these down if you get over whelmed. To be SAFE, kill them whenever you see them.\n\nAnything after 3 phases is pretty rough so don't let them live.\n\nYou can do this with very low damage in your group IF you focus mechanics and above all your tank positions those Lurchers into places that will help the whole fight.\n\nExample: Lurcher stacked on the tree when it is no longer immune, and Lurcher stacked ON stranglers.\n\nBoth of these types of tactics will allow the Lurcher to ALWAYS take damage during mechanics of any kinds so that everything is managed at once rather than trying to burst it down with no burst.\n\nAbove all, focus. Resurrecting games in this fight is pretty much a wipe.\n\n"

Because it can be utterly exhausting if people don't work together. As far as 'difficulty' is concerned, it is actually on the lower end. But this fight can last 2 minutes or an hour! And sometimes more! You MUST focus as a group.\n\nFor this you don't need, huge burst, massive dps or any of that rubbish. What you NEED is as much AOE damage as you can find.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean HIGH damage, it just means EVEN damage in area of effect rather than single target. The more area damage you have the easier it is to kill multiple targets at the same time! That is key. It's not killing each one fast, it's killing things together!\n\nFollowing the tactics in the video and/or in this guide should help you pass this with flying colours.\n\nThe healer should hover around near Selene while keeping constant heals on the group. The tank should be with the dps holding the adds close to them and managing new mechanics. More explained below.\n\n|cffff00Hoarvors|r - Selene is trying to make spiders crawl up the wall to attack Maarselok. If these anoy him enough he will come down and you can attack him. If not, then he won't. Selene needs to be active in the fight and must be protected. The Hoarvors will spawn throughout the entire fight and move slowly towards Selene. If she gets attacked by them she will be stunned and stop hitting the boss with spiders. THIS prolongs the fight. So the healer (or whoever you decide) should pay attention to these Hoarvors. They do not require killing. Simply stand NEAR one, and it will explode. If you can stay on top of this mechanic and never let any of them reach Selene, her job is a LOT easier.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - Adds very similar to those in the second boss fight. The tank should grab these asap and keep them stacked together with the DPS players in the group so they can be killed with aoe damage. These will spawn throughout the fight. Watch for the bears, their heavy attacks are nasty and must be blocked.\n\n|cffff00FUS Ro DA!|r - Throughout the fight Maarselok will shout 'Fus Ro Da!', whenever he does this you MUST block, or be thrown across the room. It doesn't hit very hard but failing to block and then having to break free from the stun, OR be thrown into unnecessary AOE damage can be a problem. So pay attention to this.\n\n|cffff00AOE|r - There are constant firing AOEs in the fight that land on players or next to players. These must be avoided. Maarselok is not careful with these, they are fired all over the place. Watch your feet or you will get overwhelmed with incoming damage FAST!\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - THIS along side the Hoarvor mechanic is KEY to this fight. Stanglers will spawn in a set area of the room constantly!\n\nThese stranglers are like wack-a-mole. They will just keep popping up over and over. They can do high damage to dps/healer players and also cause a major problem to the fight.\n\nThe hoavors must be killed to allow Selene to cast spiders up to the boss. BUT, the stranglers ATTACK the spiders which ALSO prevents them from getting to the boss, which means the fight will just go on forever if these mechanics combined are not managed!\n\nThe trick to this is to get as much stress off the spiders as possible. The way to do this is NOT to have 'high single target dps players', but instead to have as much AOE damage as possible. The bigger the area you can apply damage, the more will die at once and the less up time they have attacking the spiders.\n\nYou need to protect Selene, and Kill stranglers until enough spiders have attack Maarselok enough to bring him DOWN into the fight.\n\nThe reason the tank should keep the adds near the dps is so that they can die passively with the stranglers being hit with aoe damage types.\n\nOnce Maarselok comes down, you have a small window (around 20seconds) to damage him, then he will go back up again. He has a cap however. If he hits 65%, and 55% on the first two landings regardless of the time remaining he will go back up. This can be done in 3 phases if you have a LOT of damage but may take more if your group damage is low. BUT there is no execute mechanics, just rinse repeat. If you can do ONE phase, you can do it all.\n\n|cffff00Lurcher|r - EVERY time Maarselok goes back up into the mountains, a Lurcher will spawn. The tank should take this into the middle of the new strangler spawn point and hold it there with any other adds. While aoe should be kept up, this Lurcher is enraged the whole time and MUST be focused. Once it is down, carry on as normal.\n\nTIPS:\n\nNever let Selene get hit by Hoarvors (it will make the fight last longer)\n\nKill the stranglers will constant aoe (stops the spiders being killed and prevents the fight lasting longer)\n\nWatch your feet, and tanks, be sure you keep everything clustered up.\n\n"

As explained in the video, it is a little easier for you to go from left to right.\n\nHave the tank hover around pad two and keep the boss faced in THAT direction as much as possible even if he moves. This will give the rest of the group much more breathing space.\n\n|cffff00Fus Ro Dah|r - The boss will shout in front of him, You can block this, or dodge this. If you are in position to do so you can also stand out of it. The situation will determine which you will have to do.\n\n|cffff00Breath|r - The boss will breathe fire at the group sweeping from side to side. You MUST block this and if not block you must dodge it. If you don't you will die.\n\n|cffff00Wing Flap|r - The boss has two MASSIVE wings (if that was not already obvious). DO NOT stand on the outside of his wings. If you do, he will flap you with his wings really hard. If you accidentally do this and don't block it, you are toast.\n\n|cffff00ADDS|r - The boss will spawn adds throughout the fight. These are adds you have seen before with nasty heavy attacks and charge abilities. If the tank can manage these with taunts, then great, if not then you are on your own survival wise. So base mechanics play a role here. Blocks and interrupts are all on YOU.\n\nAbove all these adds MUST die. If you don't kill them you will get overwhelmed and the group will wipe. So long as you have plenty of aoe (and if you got this far you already do have, based on the previous boss) these should not be a problem.\n\nThe adds are the most important thing in this fight in terms of what you should be killing. The boss has NO enrage mechanic so it doesn't matter HOW long you take to kill him. But the adds will get too tough if they don't die. Take your time on the boss, keep on the mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Rain!|r - The boss will constantly be casting raining AOEs and blasts from the ground which do moderate damage if you get caught in them. Be sure to keep your wits about you and stay OUT of stupid. Negative AOE = get out. Very simple stuff at this stage, don't panic but don't get caught.\n\n|cffff00Charge|r - The boss throughout the fight once he has gone through all of his mechanics will CHARGE across the room running anyone down that stands in his path. He will charge in the direction he is aggored in. IF the tank has done as i stated at the beginning and kept their back to pad two, he will fly in THAT direction and land roughly between 1 and 2. When he goes back the other way, the tank should STILL have their back to pad two and he will go back to where he started.\n\nDeviating from this will mess everything up. Keep it simple and it is very easy to manage.\n\nThe tank can block his charge. DPS can dodge roll it or block it if they are careful but on Hard mode don't even try to block it as a dps. As you can see in the video, we have full control of his charge meaning the area between 1 and 3 is completely clear. Run away into THAT side of the room and he will never be a problem, this mechanic will NEVER touch you.\n\n|cffff00Curse (NON Hard Mode Only)|r - The boss will curse players much like the run up the mountain, where they will have to cleanse within 20seconds OR a Lurcher will come out and you will have to kill it. This ONLY applies on NON hardmode.\n\n|cffff00Selene (Hard Mode Only)|r - Selene is in the fight with her first boss mechanics. Meaning she ill need to be kept an eye on. She will constantly attempt to cast her channeling ability. If this happens she MUST be Interrupted!\n\nMajority WINS! ( Hard Mode Only)|r - The boss will call on Selene to help him, and she is now able to be attacked! You must attack Selene and interrupt her if necessary until her damage shield is gone.\n\nTHEN, you will see a SEED on the ground randomly in the room (location wise).\n\nBoth dps and the healer must take a synergy from this.\n\nEach player will see a pad lit up. Call your number! 1, 2 or 3!\n\nThis mechanic (thanks to Firefly000) is called 'Majority Wins'!\n\nIf two players have a number, but the other can see a different onethe majority wins! The odd one out must go to the number that was called by the others.\n\nIf all THREE players have the same number. The MAJORITY WINS! the TANK must go and cleanse on that pad!\n\nThe above mechanic must be done correctly, if not the person taking the synergy on the WRONG pad, will not cleanse, they will spawn a Lurcher and die!\n\nAnd that is IT! Repeat the above mechanics over and over and over until it is dead. No enrage, no execute special stuff, nothing.\n\nIf you can pass the Majority Wins mechanic ONCE, you can complete hard mode because nothing changes.\n\n|cffff00Don't DIE! (Hard Mode Only)|r - One massive note for this dungeon hardmode. IF someone dies, they will be encased in roots. You must kill this to remove it from the player BEFORE they can be resurrected. No killing roots? No res allowed\n\nGood LUCK!!!\n\n"

The tank must keep aggro at ALL time's BUT must be ready to move around a lot depending on the mechanics. The dps and healer should always be behind the boss, do NOT stand in front of him.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will throw out a long winded heavy attack which makes a HUGE aoe smash on the ground. The tank simply needs to step out of this or block it. No dps should ever stand in this. This mechanic is also used to your advantage in later mechanics (explained below).\n\n|cffff00Ice wind|r - This mechanic is pretty simple. A spinning wind (very similar to the visual for Hoarfrost in Cloudrest) will follow ONE player for a short period of time. When this happens the play should simply keep moving to avoid it stacking on them. If you stand still and it reaches you, you will take high damage. The target is random and this mechanic will repeat through out the entire fight.\n\n|cffff00Swing|r - This is very easy to see. The boss swings his weapon and in front of him, 5 small fast moving aoe effects will fly across the floor. Simply don't stand in them. They don't do a huge amount of damage but when the boss enrages it can one shot dps players, so stay out of his face unless you are the tank.\n\n|cffff00Enrage!|r - This mechanic is the tank killer. During the fight the boss will roar and fear players. When this happens the boss will glow red and be enraged. He takes extra damage in this phase but also does extra damage. This is when the tank must kite (move around the room) and maintain a taunt while the boss calms down! Try to keep the boss aggroed 100% of the time, while keeping him close to the group's damage abilities that maybe on the ground. Do NOT get hit by the boss, if he hits you, you will most likely die to a one shot. Only very few tanks can stand up to his attacks. Once he has calmed down, carry on as you were before and hold the boss still.\n\n|cffff00Ice Atronachs|r - During the fight the boss will spawn Ice Atronachs. These are very simple. If you can spot them early, get the tank to stack the boss on them as they are spawning and the boss will cast his heavy attack mechanic. If successful, the ice atronach will be smashed to pieces.\n\nIf you were too slow, it will spawn fully and you will have to kill it. They follow the same mechanics as the adds you encountered on the way up to the fight. Kill them as soon as you can, they are your primary focus. If you have lots of damage you can kill them fast, if you have low damage, be sure to buff up with resists and lots of heals because they will go into a phase where they will damage all players rapidly over time.\n\nAgain if you can get the giant to smash them you will never have to fight them, but if you don't you will have to kill them and if you don't get rid of them within at least 30seconds or so, you will get another and another.\n\nFocus mechanics!\n\n"

This can be over in seconds, or take a long time. The choice is yours. The tank should maintain a taunt on her at all times, the group should be fairly spread out behind her and be sure to repeat this formation as and when she teleports.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss has some horrible ranged attacks be sure to block these if you see them being aimed at you. The tank should be the only one getting hit by this so if you are a dps or healer and these are coming your way, be sure to dodge roll on time.\n\n|cffff00Ice|r - The boss will cast ice on people, you can avoid this but if you get caught in it you will take damage and be immobilized. You must dodge roll to break free from this.\n\n|cffff00Wind|r - Position is KEY. If you stack too much it will be hard to avoid this mechanic. Basically the boss will have a spreading aoe under her feet and once it pops you will take damage AND she will emit several wind aoes in random directions. If you stand back a bit you can avoid these and get in the gaps to let it pass. If you stack you may take damage from more than one source at a time and die. Be ready for this and pay attention to it.\n\n|cffff00Fire!|r - During the fight one random person on rotation will get a fire effect around them. They must be healed during this and will take small damage from it. however if this touches other people they will take HIGH damage from it. Keep your distance from other players! You can cleanse this but on this fight, do NOT do this. Be sure to let it run it's course as this player plays an important role to the next mechanic.\n\n|cffff00Stranglers|r - Ice covered stranglers will enter the room so keep looking around for these. While they are in ice they cannot be fully damaged and will fire at players with very high damage single target spit attacks. The player covered in fire must run over to these stranglers and basically hug them. Doing so for a couple of seconds will melt the ice and they will be able to be killed. These MUST die else the group will take far too much damage.\n\n"

Turn the boss away from the group and hold him still do NOT run around the room.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is a simple heavy attack. If you are the tank and this is on you be sure to block it. It will do fire damage as well so be careful not to be low health while blocking. Maintain your resources. It is very similar to that of Grothdar in Vaults of Madness.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - During the fight you will be attacked by many different adds spawning from the runes on the ground. There are wraiths, zombies, and skeletons. Of course these should be your main focus and you should be sure to kill these and then go back to the boss once they are dealt with. The wraiths must be interrupted and the skeletons have a unique mechanic...\n\nThey attach a beam to a chosen player and drain their health but will NOT listen to a tank's taunt. They can be chained/immobilized/stunned but NOT taunted. SO with this in mind, it is obvious that running away does nothing. Try to get these close to the boss so the tank can control them. Running away while these are on you will inevitably kill you.\n\n|cffff00Fire whirlwinds|r - Around the 50% health mark of the boss there will be fast moving spinning whirlwinds of fire in the room trying to kill your group. High resists and good heal over time can basically negate these but, if your group is built squishy, you do NOT want to get hit by these, so try to avoid them as much as you can. Defensive buffs and ultimates should be utilized here.\n\n|cffff00Fire POP!|r - During the fight (mostly on the tank) there will be popping fire effects that make large circles of stupid on the ground. Try to avoid these, they do a lot of damage even for a tank!\n\n"

Many don't pass this OR fail their no death achievement son this one because they get sloppy and panic. The boss should be tanked in the middle of the room as much as possible while the group attack in a semi circle rotation from behind the boss. While this is technically a stack and burn, the damage coming from the boss prevents this unless your group has some serious buff and heal bonuses applied. So be ready to move a lot in your OWN places, not running at each other!|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This heavy attack must be blocked. It is delayed too and hits before the animation is finished so be sure to hit that block button as SOON as you know it is coming. Don't miss time it. If you are a dps and this is coming your way, the only way to live is a well placed dodge roll. Remember it IS delayed so dodge before the animation hits or you will feel like you received a desync.\n\n|cffff00Lightning Call|r - During the fight the boss will constantly call lightning at each player's feet. They are fast paced spreading aoe effects that will POP and do lightning damage. If you are fast moving in a nice circle away from each other you can avoid these, OR you can block them but they do hurt a lot. Too many of these blocking or not, will kill you. So move about a fair bit to avoid them but remember do NOT run at each other, else yours and someone else's will stack up and you BOTH die.\n\n|cffff00Ice|r - The boss will cast ice Pillars in the room that do damage and at the same time will immobilize all players with a seperate ice effect, you must dodge roll to break out of this or cleanse it.\n\n|cffff00JUMP!|r - The boss occasionally jump in the air, when this happens he will come crashing down. There are faint visuals about where he is going to land and you can move away but to be safe, BLOCK. If he lands on your head and you are not ready for it, he WILL kill you. A tank may stand up to it but a dps will not.\n\n|cffff00Storm Atronachs|r - During the fight (usually about 55% and 40%) there are 3x Atronachs that spawn (usually after his jump). These must be killed. They are very low health but they channel lightning at the boss and everyone takes damage over time.\n\n|cffff00JUMP!|r - At 40% or less(depending on dps in the group) the boss will channel energy from the sky. During this time players will take damage over time. You can burn the boss or live through the mechanic and he will return to normal mechanics after a few seconds. BUT it depends on your group.\n\nLuckily there are no 'if you don't do this you die' enrage mechanics to the channel itself, you can out last it, but if you are in a group where the damage is low, you should buff up and have heavy heals. Use your ultimates at this phase for whichever side of the fence you are on. High damage can nuke it (if they can stay alive), low damage need to stay alive and can just pace it.\n\nMOST people wipe here because they get greedy. Save those ultimates for THIS phase.\n\n"

So relax and understand each boss. All of the mechanics to the hard mode have already been taught to you along the way. You just have to do them again, with more stuff in the room! The tank MUST maintain a taunt on the active boss at the time, else this will end fast and people will start taking heavy attack one shots.\n\nThe basics to the boss is that there are 4 of them. they will be covered in damage shields but ONE will be exposed. It starts from left to right going clock wise, boss 1, to 4. each time one is 0 health it will cover it's self in a damage shield and the next will be vulnerable. This happens for ONE lap. Then after number 4 is finished with, each phase one of them will randomly be able to be attacked. Keep your eyes peeled!\n\nEach witch that goes to 0 health will take 10% off the overall health bar of the encounter!\n\n|cffff00Shields!|r - Every time a witch hits 0% health, they will shield up and all 4 of them will channel damage over time at the group. Each boss must be interrupted to stop this. So split up and hit one each, and then get back to the mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Lightning|r - During the fight you will have the lightning from the sky mechanic where you must watch your feet in order to avoid it. This is the same as the Icereach Warrior mechanic you encountered. Do not stack, do not run into each other.\n\n|cffff00Wind|r - This is the same wind mechanic you saw in the first boss fight with the giant. Simply keep away from it and don't run at the group with it until it fades.\n\n|cffff00Fire!|r - This is the fire mechanic from the second boss where you must melt the ice of the stranglers! This can be cleansed but MUST be used to melt the stranglers.\n\nTIP: This fire mechanic is only 'useful' to us when the second witch is exposed. If she is in shields, then no stranglers will spawn, so you are free to cleanse it.\n\n|cffff00Skeletons|r - These spawn throughout the fight and are the same as the ones you encountered in the third boss fight with the flesh atronach. They will NOT stop chasing the player until they are dead. Kill them fast and above all, don't run away! Bring them to the fight/tank and then relax and get rid of them. They can't be taunted, so running will just kill you.\n\n|cffff00Gohlla, Witch One (hardmode)|r - This boss spawns the giant you fought as the first boss. He has much less health but the same mechanics. While this is alive you are going to have issues with him enraging, the tank having to kite him and all the other mechanics he has. Simply focus this target and THEN kill the witch. The witch will do heavy attacks so be sure she is taunted. Once she is 0Health she will be shielded and the next witch will be exposed so she can recover.\n\n|cffff00Hiti, Witch Two (hardmode)|r - This witch follows the same rules as the second boss you encountered. She spawns ice stranglers which you must deal with and melt the ice+kill them before they nuke the group. These can hit very hard, deal with them asap. Once the witch is defeated the next will be exposed.\n\n|cffff00Bani, Witch Three (hardmode)|r - This witch has the adds mechanic from the third boss you encountered. Wraths, zombies and skeletons will spawn and they MUST be killed. Focus all of the adds before killing the witch each time they spawn to eliminate potential overlapping mechanics from over nuking. One the witch hits 0 health she will shield and the next one will be exposed.\n\n|cffff00Maefyn, Witch Four (hardmode)|r - This witch has the same mechanics as the boss number 4 you encountered before here. You will have to fight the Ice warrior. Be sure to kill him and his adds before killing the witch to prevent overlapping mechanics. The ice warrior has the same mechanics as the boss version where he will of course jump and land on people's heads.\n\nTIP: Each other above mechanics must be understood and followed and once you know how each witch works it becomes a lot easier to manage when the switches start getting random after the first lap.\n\n|cffff00Execute|r - at 20% the main boss will be in the middle of the room channeling some huge aoe damage being powered up by each witch around the room (like the atronachs did to the icereach warrior).\n\nThis is where you should save your ultimates for. You will need to keep your survival and your damage up and keep going until it is dead. During this phase you will have the fire, lightning and ice mechanics.\n\nNON hardmode does NOT have the previous boss mechanics and adds. It is no where near as stressful. This will take practice so best of luck!\n\n"

This will really test the ability of the players with the grapple hook mechanic (aka batman). The tank MUST maintain a taunt on the boss at all times and hold him as still as possible.\n\nThe dps/healers will have to be aware of their surroundings.\n\nThe boss will never move but the group will have to, so keep your eyes open.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will throw out a occasionally at the tank. Simply block this and you will be fine.\n\n|cffff00Big BOOM!|r - This mechanic is pretty simple but fiddly. The boss start channeling and the platform you are on and multiple others will have a spreading aoe on them. If you are standing on ANY of those platforms when it explodes, you will die and/or be thrown off the edge.\n\nHere you must look for a SAFE platform and grapple to safety until the explosion is over. Once it has gone you can get back into the middle again.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - After 75% the boss will spawn adds around the room. These archers are a BIG problem and they will try to take aim on random individual targets.\n\nIf they succeed they will throw the player off the edge and kill them.\n\nDuring their channeled up take aim ability you have a few options to prevent it.\n\nYou can interrupt the target (close or long ranged).\n\nYou can have your tank pull them in to the fight and kill them with the boss.\n\nOR the safe option is to have one of your dps work on the adds. Simply go to each add and kill them one by one to prevent them from nuking people.\n\nHow you deal with them is up to you and your group but be sure you 100% interrupt them while they channel or it is game over fast!g this phase you will have the fire, lightning and ice mechanics.\n\nNON hardmode does NOT have the previous boss mechanics and adds.

His basic attacks are not so bad but his major mechanics can hit very hard! The tank should always maintain a taunt of course and turn the boss away from the group at all times!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will throw out a long winded heavy attack which does a very high amount of damage. If you are a dps/healer you must dodge roll this or you will die. However if you are the tank you must block this, BUT try to be sure you have full health or high health at the time. Blocking this at half health or low health especially if you are not a very chunky tank, will one shot you. If you are a very low health tank you may want to take the chicken approach on this one and carefully time a dodge roll to avoid it.\n\n|cffff00Lich Crystals|r - This mechanic is pretty simple. The boss will throughout the fight cast double lich crystals on the floor. There will be a spreading AOE and then an explosion once it peaks in size. Simply step out of these and don't let them hit you. Getting hit by one will take a dps/healer to at least half health but if they are already low or get hit by a couple at once they will die.\n\n|cffff00Totem|r - The boss will occasionally summon a Totem into the room. When you spot this you must kill it as soon as possible. If you do not, it will channel constant magical bolts of damage at the group. The longer this is up the more damage it does and could cause a potential wipe. Be sure to focus this down as soon as it is summoned.\n\n|cffff00Malcoms! (flesh Abombinations)|r - This mechanic is very simple. The boss at around the 70% and 20% health (depending on dps, you can overshoot this) he will teleport to the side of the room and release a flesh abomination! These are fairly lot health but must be killed asap. They have a huge spreading AOE slam on the ground that must be avoided. If you try to burn too fast and ignore these adds you will end up with two of them. Which is unnecessary. Kill them as they spawn and THEN carry on with the mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - During the fight the boss will spawn undead wolves, be sure to kill these fast as they can put pressure on the group. The tank should try to hold these next to the boss to avoid them scattering around the room.\n\n|cffff00Juffy mode! (transformation)|r - At 0% health he will wolf out! The boss transforms into a Hulking Werewolf! This is where the fight gets a little scatty so do NOT panic. The same mechanics as above still persist, with the lich crystals and such but you do have a couple more mechanics to deal with.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - The boss will stamp on the ground causing a large spreading aoe on the ground. You must avoid this so simply step out of it when you see it.\n\n|cffff00Charge!|r - The boss will charge in the direction he chooses and will run all players in his path down, causing huge damage! You must avoid this.\n\nAlso as he charges, many undead adds will spawn and will have to be dealt with. The tank should try to stack these up while the group try to keep passive AOE damage down on the floor to help get them down as they spawn.\n\n"

This is the pug killer of pug killers.\nThere is a simple rule in this fight above all. Follow the mechanics, or die!\n\nThere are four platforms on the ground and three grapple points up the top above your heads. These are very important.\n\nThe tank should hold the boss on one of the four concrete squares to start with and hold it still. The rest is as follows below. Do NOT drop taunt.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss has a fairly harsh heavy attack. If you are a tank you should have no issues blocking this and you won't take much damage. But a dps or healer will be one shot, so if for some reason this is aiming at you and you are NOT a tank, be sure to dodge roll it.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r -  Around the room there are many standing statues that you cannot interact with. These will come to life and join the fight at 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%.\n\nThe tank should grab these as soon as possible without spinning the boss and stack them all together. The group should focus these down as soon as possible.\n\nWatch out for over burning on the dps side with the boss because otherwise you can end up with way too many adds in the room and it can be tricky to manage depending on your group.\n\nBe sure to block if these adds try to heavy attack and be warned, they CAN chain players back in if they are too far away or up top.\n\nRemember above all, if you have aggro, bring things to the TANK, do NOT run around the room like a headless chicken, it will not help at all.\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - The boss will cast a cleave attack swinging his weapon in the direction of whoever has aggro. it is important that the boss is turned away from the group at all times so this is avoided and ONLY on the tank. Blocking this will be just fine, but the group should not be standing in it. Stay behind the boss if you are dps/healer players.\n\n|cffff00The kiln!!!!|r - This is the most important mechanic in the entire fight. The Kiln/room sets on fire, and you now fight against the clock.\n\nOn the ground at 90% 60% and 30% you will be presented with 4x runes.\n\nEach one has a number of sigils visible inside of them from 1-4.\n\nUp above are 3 platforms with a grapple point on each.\n\nONE of those points tells you WHICH symbol/sigil is the one you are looking for.\n\nPlayers (dps and healer or a couple of dps) must grapple up and find the symbol. Once it is found, they must activate the symbol.\n\nThis will reveal to the tank WHICH one is the real one. It will have a swirling visual around it.\n\nThe tank must then position the boss on top of it.\n\nWhen the boss is in place the group must break the damage shield the boss has on it in order for it to start taking damage. If successful, the boss will stab his sword into the sigil on the ground and you will all be safe.\n\nIf you fail, the entire group will burn to death. No coming back from it, no out healing. DEAD is DEAD.\n\nNote: If you are one of the people up the top finding the symbol, you will have to protect yourself against archers. These also fire down at the group with arrow barrage so watch your feet and don't die.\n\nIf you do this correctly you are safe, if you do it wrong you are dead. This is one of if not THE most unforgiving mechanic in the entire dungeon.\n\n"

Simply block this and you will be fine.\n\n|cffff00Totem|r - This mechanic is the same as the first boss. Kill the totem or constantly take damage and die.\n\n|cffff00Goliath!|r - The boss will transform into a Bone Goliath for a few seconds at around 70-65% health, making her much stronger. So long as it is taunted by the tank this really is more mouth than action. Just keep doing what you are doing and be sure your healer has some passive HOTs running so people don't take to much damage during this phase form aoe damage.\n\n|cffff00She's ESCAPING!|r - This mechanic is SO much fun but people panic and die way too easy.\n\nThe boss will teleport to the place you first came from and is trying to escape. She will do this at 75% ish and then again around 40% she will travel BACK to where you just came from.\n\nWhen she goes to the other island you must use the grapple to get across.\n\nThis is a double grapple mechanic where if you are too slow you will fall and die.\n\nWhen you reach the boss she will have a damage shield and a slow spreading aoe under her. You need to break her damage shield first, THEN interrupt her to stop her channeling. If you do this the fight will continue. If you fail she will escape and the fight is over, you have failed until the next time you come into the dungeon and try again. Do NOT fail!\n\nTIP: Aim your camera (as explained in the video) ROUGHLY in the area, you don't have to be 100% accurate, but if you try to be too precise you will panic, waste time and fail.\n\n"

The stack and burn way, or the safe way. Which way you choose is entirely up to you but the main thing you need to do is NOT panic. The boss should be turned away from the group at all times.\n\nIf your group has brought with it LOTS of damage mitigation skills/gear/ultimates and plenty of healing. you can stand together tightly stacked and nuke the hell out of it with ease, even with low damage in the group it is doable.\n\nHowever if you do not have this and generally you are quite a squishy group, then mechanics should be followed (explained below).\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - This is a simple heavy attack. If you are the tank and this is on you be sure to block it. It will do fire damage as well so be careful not to be low health while blocking. If you are a dps/healer and for some stupid reason you have aggro...you must dodge roll it or die.\n\n|cffff00Swords throwing|r - The boss will cross his arms and power up a powerful sword throwing mechanic. This is basically identical to every air atronach you have ever seen. If you see this happening, you can block the attack, OR simply interrupt it and it won't happen.\n\n|cffff00Adds/reflections|r - At 90% 70% 50% and 30% health the boss will spawn 4x adds/reflections with the same appearance as him. Basically his mini me type minions. These will all spin and spin doing fast paced damage over time to anyone caught in their aoe. They all have a gap in the aoe in the middle. If you manage to stand outside of the spin or in the middle of it and not touch the aoe, you will be untouched.\n\nHere you have 2 options.\n\nOption 1: Stay out of the damage circles and spread out. Kill the adds separate from the boss and then come back in again after they are dead.\n\nOption 2: Stack directly under the boss, hold your ground, stack as much damage mitigation as you can in form of resists, buffs, damage shields, maim and protection while maintaining HEAVY heals. If you can do this and stay alive successfully, you can stack and burn every single phase.\n\n|cffff00SPIN!|r - Just like the adds the boss has a devastating spin mechanic. The circle has a gap in the middle. Either stay in the gap, or stay way out of the circle. Either way they choice is yours. This all depends on which option from above of 1 or 2 you have chosen.\n\nNOTE: The spin usually comes when the adds are in the room also doing theirs at the same time. Be careful.\n\n"

If you don't pay attention to them, you are dead. Plain and simple. The tank should keep aggro at all times and hold the boss in the middle of the room while being fast enough to grab any new adds that spawn. Do NOT drop taunt.\n\nAlso i hope you practiced your batman skills before this boss, you are going to need them!\n\n|cffff00Bone Colossus/ghosts|r - During the fight the boss will spawn ghost adds and a massive bone colossus along with some small ghost type adds. The ghosts are not too much of a problem and can die to even low aoe damage but should of course be killed.\n\nThe bone colossus on the other hand MUST be focused. If you don't kill it you can end up with multiple over time depending on the damage in your group.\n\nThe tank MUST taunt this as soon as possible and hold it by the boss. The colossus has a massive devastating heavy attack.\n\nIf you are a tank you can block it and you will be fine (but it will knock you back even if blocking) however if this heavy attack is aimed at a dps or a healer, do NOT block it, you will 100% die. You must dodge roll it very carefully.\n\nIf it starts winding up, count 3, 2, 1 dodge! Too early and you die, too late and you die. It has a very precise timing.\n\n|cffff00GET OUT!!|r - At around 80% health and at around 40% health, the boss will become immune and toxic gases will fill the room! If you stay here you will die!\n\nEvery player must get out of the middle and use the grapple points around the edges to get to safety.\n\nThere are ghosts at certain random points and they must be killed. Once they are all dead you can return to the middle as the gas will have faded.\n\n|cffff00HIDE!|r - At about 60% health (depending on dps) and also again at around 20% the boss will go full wraith mode.\n\nBasically he will have 4x menders (ghosts) around the room and they will be channeling him to keep his resistance and health up. You must kill the ghosts to lessen their hold oh him. If you kill them all the phase is over, but for each one you kill you can hit him a bit harder.\n\nHowever, during this phase he is powering up for huge explosions that stun and cause massive damage. If you are caught you will die.\n\nSo what you need to do here is hide behind the grapple points behind the pillars. If the grapple point is glowing yellow while you are behind it also glowing, you are protected from the incoming explosion, if not, they you are not protected and you will die.\n\nSo, during this phase, stay behind the pillars, kill the ghosts, and then come back into the middle once it is all over.\n\nNOTE: Mechanics CAN overlap so be careful. Some play risky, some play safe. What you do about that is up to you.\n\n"

The room is massive so you have a LOT of space but that is a a very good reason. There is going to be a lot to deal with.\n\nThe tank should focus on keeping the boss as central as possible and use the middle grapple hook as a pivot point. Keep the boss turned away from the group at all times and do NOT drop taunt.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will throw out a occasionally at the tank. Simply block this and you will be fine.\n\n|cffff00Stomp!|r - The boss will stamp the floor and place a huge damage over time aoe on the ground. Usually around 90% and 40%. Do NOT stand in this. Each time he places one, as the tank, you should shift around the grapple post pivot slightly ready to place the next one close to or overlapping it but in a safe space. If you spread out too much this can end up filling the room.\n\nHere you must look for a SAFE platform and grapple to safety until the explosion is over. Once it has gone you can get back into the middle again.\n\n|cffff00Skeletons|r - After the stomp skeletons will spawn from the aoe sections. There will be a couple of small ones which are not really a problem and die to passive aoe, but there is ONE two hander. IF you do not kill him you are going to have problems. Overlapping mechanics will take over you and people will likely die.\n\nThis add must be taunted by the tank asap! He has a huge heavy attack and a dps/healer will not be able to block it, they must dodge roll if they are targeted or die.\n\n|cffff00GOO!|r - During the fight the boss will punch into the ground causing aoe circles to be placed on the ground (avoid these) but around the same time Large Ooze type enemies will spawn. These in the early stages will be fairly low health and mostly die to aoe damage, but as the fight goes on they get bigger and bigger!\n\nSome end up with around 11m+ health!\n\nYou do NOT need to try to kill these doing 11million damage. If you grapple THROUGH the targets they will split in two. Making two smaller ones, rinse repeat till they are dead. You can physically kill them by grappling through them.\n\nYou can stack and burn the boss of course if you have high damage and mechanical awareness, but if following the mechanics, this can be a life saver as it can get a little hectic.\n\n"

If you are a low health tank you are most likely going to die here. I would recommend stacking into some health in this fight!\n\nAs the tank be sure to taunt the boss at all times and as demonstrated in the video, ALWAYS turn him away from the group. The dps/healer should be behind the boss as much as possible slightly spread out.\n\nNote: Hardmode he hits a LOT harder and changes his health from 8.5mil to 18mil!!\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will heavy attack the tank, this is a BIG hitting ability and MUST be blocked. no block = dead tank, you WON'T survive.\n\n|cffff00Grasp|r - The boss will cast a grasping skeletal hand from the ground under the tank. This can be blocked (damage wise) but unless using immovable will stun/cc the tank. The tank MUST break free as fast as possible.\n\nThe hit is not only capable of killing a tank outright but also if it didn't quite kill them, overlapping incoming mechanics will finish the job.\n\nBe careful and pay attention!\n\n|cffff00Grave Dust|r - This mechanic is the pug killer mechanic unless you know how to manage it. The boss will raise his hand VERY fast, and from under him will be multiple fast moving Grave dust like effects. Similar to the stomp from the behemoth in maelstrom round 7. However, these hit incredibly hard!!\n\nIF you are super fast and spot it you can block it. If you are at range you can weave away from it, but lets make it a bit simpler for you shall we?\n\nThe damage type of this is MAGIC damage. Stack heavy into spell resistance with buffs, bonuses, group and champion points. If you are stacking HIGH spell resistance, you can basically just fight through it with incoming heals and this mechanic never has to be a problem again.\n\nI would still recommend blocking if you can see it coming though.\n\n|cffff00Cages!|r - This mechanic is where the boss will cast a cluster of cage like rocks on the ground. If you stay in this for more than a second as a dps/healer, you may as well say good night. Do NOT stand/stay in this, get out fast.\n\nThey spawn, and then rapidly explode with a massive domino type effect. This is a life or death mechanic.\n\n|cffff00Mines|r - The boss will cast multiple bolts (note he usually does a spreading burst aoe before this so watch your feet)all at once which will land in random locations all around the room. When they land they will appear to be horns/bones on the ground. This is very simple, they are land mines!\n\nDon't stand in them!\n\n|cffff00Skeletons/Blastbones|r - The boss during the fight will summon Blastbones and a slow moving two hander wielding skeleton. They try to reach the runes on the ground for more power.\n\nThe main focus here should be on the two hander. Kill him fast, he can be cc'd also. If you don't kill him before he reaches the middle he will heal to full health and just be really annoying to deal with again. So focus him.\n\nThe blastbones need to be killed as fast as possible IF possible. Remember these are made to explode so you have a choice here.\n\nIf you kill them they will of course die, BUT if their reach the runes and power up they will explode doing HUGE aoe damage.\n\nIf you cannot kill these in time you can block the damage, or have a very well placed dodge roll and completely avoid them. This will take timing and practice but if you finish this phase, simply go back to the boss and carry on until it happens again.\n\nThese are on a timer however so the longer the fight the more it will happen. Maintain your stamina in case dodging is your choice OR only option.\n\nThis phase is the most important and should always take priority.\n\nThe boss has no official enrage, so you can take as long as you like so long as you deal with these mechanics when they happen and don't die too much playing 'res games'.\n\n|cffff00BIG BOY!|r - If you don't like jump scares, then too bad for you. This boss shows off how much of a necromancer he really is and summons a humongous bone colossus giant!\n\nThis has a bigger bark than bite but there are some basic mechanics you must follow.\n\nHe will cast a frost breath every so often, simply dodgeroll or block to avoid/mitigate the damage.\n\nAlso he will cast a fireball at one target and place a huge aoe on the ground. Simply avoid this and don't stand in it.\n\nNOTE: panicking players running away are more likely to be targeted. Don't lose your head.\n\nTIPS: During execute the mechanic do NOT change. So, if you got this far, it's inevitable that you can do it. Don't change a thing, focus mechanics and keep doing what you are doing. Good luck!\n\n"

Unlike most fights this one is HEAVY on the tanks! You will need both tanks to be on their A game and work together throughout. Yolo tanks or people that refuse to work as a team are going to struggle here. Both bosses must stay apart except for certain phases of the mechanics else they will enrage and do stupidly high damage to the group. So, each tank needs to take their OWN boss and control them AWAY from the other. A simple way to do this is to split them each on opposite sides of the room. So long as the beam is not connecting them, the distance between them is fine.\n\nThere are many different tactics people use on this fight but a simple and safe method is to have the two bosses on opposite sides of the room and have your group stacked together in the middle. This way everyone is inside heals, damage shields and buff range all of the time in case anything gets a little two stressful. Each boss has the same mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Tail Whip|r - The boss will whip it's tail in the direction of whoever has agro (should be the tank of course) . When this happens there will be multiple fast moving lightning balls across the floor behind the boss aiming at the group.\n\nYou can get in the gaps of these to avoid them but if you are going to get hit by them be sure to BLOCK them! They used to stun and do high damage, now they just hit hard but they do also apply minor vulnerability to you meaning all enemies in the room will hit you harder for 3-4 seconds.\n\nNOTE: Both bosses can do this at the same time and these can cross over, so be sure that you DO block these. If you fail and survive ONE of them the OTHER will kill you. Don't panic, don't run around, just block it, and move on with the rest of the mechanics.\n\n|cffff00JUMP/Heavy Attack|r - The bosses will hit the tank with a heavy attack which MUST be blocked else they will be knocked down. While this is pretty straight forward another heavy attack that happens is in the form of a jump and this happens randomly AND if the tank is too far away from it's aggroed target. So be sure when moving around, you don't make the gap too large between you and it.\n\nThe major issue with the jump/heavy if you miss the block, is that the boss will stand on the tank and munch on them while they are on the ground. If a member of the group does not interrupt the boss doing this, the tank will die. SO you MUST pay attention and help the tanks out if they get pinned to the ground. Remember, BOTH bosses have the same mechanics so it is possible that both could potentially get pinned at the same time. Keep your eyes open for that interruptible mechanic/telegraph.\n\n|cffff00Sphere Damage Shields (boss beams!)|r - The Dwemer Spheres around the room will spawn during the fight, and get faster and faster through out (eventually ending up with many at a time). These spawn around the room on the edge of the main circle of the platform. You CANNOT harm these while their damage shield is active.\n\nThis is a KEY mechanic and both tanks MUST co-ordinate clean and fast in order to succeed.\n\nThe ONLY way to break the damage shield, is to being BOTH bosses within range of each other to make the electrical beam form between them. Once the beam connects the two, so long as the Dwemer Sphere is IN the beam, the damage shield will be broken.\n\nSo the tanks must bring them in, break the shield and split up again FAST!\n\nThe longer the beam is linked the more likely your group will wipe. While they are connected they do massive damage and eventually full enrage and you will all die. Be sure to get in, and get out fast and clean. This will take practice and the tanks need to gel well together in order for this to be performed.\n\nCo-ordination is key here. Once you have gotten comfortable, this can be relatively simple, but people need to leave their egos at the door in this fight, you MUST work as a team.\n\n|cffff00Take Aim (TOP Priority mechanic!)|r - The Dwemer Spheres ALL have the ability to 'take aim' or 'snipe' the group. IF this hits a player, they will take a one shot and die. It is IMPERATIVE that your group does NOT miss the opportunity to INTERRUPT this mechanic.\n\nSome people like to have one person assigned to interrupts. This for new groups is a terrible idea. Because if that person dies, people will not be paying enough attention to a job they are not assigned to.\n\nIn new groups make sure that your entire group is aware that this is the most important mechanic in the entire fight and no interrupts = dead.\n\nHave your whole group paying attention and make it their priority to stop this mechanic happening. If 5 people interrupt the same target, at least it was done!\n\n|cffff00Poison injection|r - The Dwemer Spheres will cast poison injection type damage over time abilities at random players in the group. This is a devastating damage over time ability and will kill people very very fast. Players need this cleansed ASAP! Be sure that you have purify (from templars if you have them) and/or purge on multiple people. Purge is expensive but you will need this through out the fight. No purge means you are pretty much going to be playing rez games all day long picking up people you couldn't heal.\n\nBe sure to cure/cleanse all of these abilities FAST. Killing the Dwemer Spheres does take off the pressure but they will be constantly spawning too, so stay on top of this!\n\n|cffff00Scarabs|r - The fight will have a group of scarabs spawning in and attacking random members of the group at 75% 50% and 25% of the total health of the combined bosses (use the boss health bar at the top of the screen to see the overall). You really should save your ultimates for these phases if you can help it and get rid of them fast! They can be very overwhelming and cause a lot of damage. They can be chained and rooted but taunt will not control them and you REALLY don't want these on the tank. They are getting hit hard enough. Dispatch these enemies as fast as you can with aoe damage/ultimates if you have them.\n\nThe overall fight can take as LONG as you like, there is no rush but these guys must take priority when they spawn.\n\n|cffff00Ground Lightning|r - The bosses will occasionally fling lightning at a random player which will land as a big circle on the ground (usually aimed at the tank) this is very simpledo NOT stand in it. Even the toughest tanks will die in just a couple of ticks.\n\nEXECUTE: At low health you need to be in full control of the bosses. You can either burn one to low health and then the other, or fight them evenly split in two groups and gradually go through the fight. But either way do NOT kill one boss too early.\n\nBe sure that one ONLY dies when YOU decide. The safest way to do this is to get both bosses down to about 20% and then gradually get them both low enough so you kill one and then VERY soon kill the other. So get them both down to about 1million health and bounce between the two until one drops, and then finish the other with ultimates.\n\nThe reason you don't want one to die before the other TOO soon is because once one dies, the other will enrage and so will the rest of the room.\n\nThe fight can take as LONG as you like. BUT, the lower both their health at the end the less time you have to deal with all the spheres in the room and the boss glowing red.\n\nIf you kill one too early, you are in trouble. Pace it, get them down evenly to a point if you can and then finish the job quickly.\n\nThat enrage mechanic only happens when you kill one or the other so you are in full control of it. No yoloing ;)\n\n"

There is no full enrage or execute phase as such so you can take as LONG as you like. BUT you will have to follow some mechanics very specifically if you wish to survive.\n\nThe tank should hold the boss STILL and central if possible faced away from the group, IF the group is already fairly advanced or just comfortable. Failing that if they are new, place the boss facing the corner in the far back of the room (this is to help with a very particular mechanic ).\n\n|cffff00Staff attack|r - The boss will flip his staff around like a ninja and then wack the tank with it with a little jump. When this happens the tank must block it and lightning will splash around at the group. This is the same as the tail whip from the first boss. Simple block the damage or get in the gaps if you are not the tank (dps and healers). This does apply damage over time and vulnerability so can be cleansed although it  is short lived so ground heals should be more than enough.\n\n|cffff00Streak|r - Occasionally the boss will streak to a target (usually the furthest away but not always) so stay close to the group. When he does this he will place an aoe on the ground which you MUST stay out of. So long as aggro is maintained he will run back to the tank and continue as normal. Don't chase him around the room and don't panic. This is a simple mechanic.\n\n|cffff00Charging up|r - This is VERY simple but most people panic like hell. Do not panic!\n\nThe boss will channel energy at the group and 4 members will have a spreading aoe under their feet. Once it hits it's full size each player in the room will take damage. This does NOT require you to run around the room, spread out, stack whatever. This is stopped by a simple INTERRUPT.\n\nInterrupt the boss and it is all over, mechanic passed!\n\n|cffff00Centurion Steam|r - Shortly after the fight starts and every 60seconds onwards, centurions will spawn, usually around once a minute. These do not have a huge amount of health but do need to be killed.\n\nYou can stack this on the boss fight and kill it with the boss at the same time or pull it to one side and focus it. Entirely up to you as a group whichever works for you. However, their steam attack MUST be paid attention to.\n\nThey will stand still and cast large triangle steam aoe attacks front and back, and then side to side, and then front and back again. NO where is safe. Get ranged and get OUT of it. The damage ticks are incredibly high and each tick stacks a healing debuff getting more and more aggressive. If this hits a dps/healer they will die in 2-3 ticks of damage. If a tank gets hit, they will take so such a large negative healing debuff (and high damage) that it will be hard for them to survive while tanking the boss.\n\nIf you are a nuke group, you can kill it while on the boss before this mechanic even happens sometimes, if not, your off tank should take this enemy to one side so you as a group can deal with it away from the main fight.\n\nAgain however the choice is yours. Their steam attack happens once every 30seconds on spawned Centurions. Unless you kill it faster.\n\n|cffff00Upstairs|r - Divayth will call that the fabricants are powering up (this happens on a 90 second timer starting from the end of each successful phase), when this happens 4 players from the group need to get on one of the 4 surrounding platforms on the outer part of the room and click the synergy to go upstairs.\n\nWhile upstairs there are 4x Dwemer Spheres which must be killed.\n\nStay together, you will need to take self heals/shields etc to stay alive up there. Go from one to the next to the next killing them together as a group.\n\nOne person will get a lightning beam on them which does HIGH damage, and for this to stop hurting AND for you to be able to hit the Spheres, you must stand behind them (between the add and the hole in the ground) so the beam cuts through the damage shield exposing their health bar.\n\nOnce all Spheres are dead, each player should go to the location they came up stairs at (or just one console each) and there will be a synergy console on each player's location. Get someone to count down from 3-2-1 and then ALL press the buttons at the same time. If people are a little off it is not the end of the world but you must press them very close together. You will see steam coming out of the main area when someone has pressed theirs so if yours has not gone off yet, DO IT!\n\nOnce this is successful the holes in the ground will have a shielded affect on them which you can use to jump back down safely and rejoin the fight.\n\nNOTE: do not come downstairs before it is over because you will splat on the ground.\n\nThis mechanic must be completed quickly because if you are up there too long the whole group downstairs will be peppered with meteors and everyone will die. You have 60 seconds for your group to successfully complete this mechanic or it is a wipe.\n\n|cffff00Shock Meteors|r - Throughout the fight meters will come down from the sky. These actually don't hit that hard and you can live through them with good heals on the ground. Don't panic. You can block them if you feel too squishy and should spread out a little when they land. Try not to stack too tight else damage will overlap. Most people panic too much on this mechanic. Heavy heals and don't run around in circles and you can more or less ignore it. Just don't do anything stupid!\n\n|cffff00Cleave|r - The boss will cast a large triangular aoe at the group knocking them backwards. You can step out of this before it goes off, or block it.\n\n|cffff00Shades|r - From 75% onwards the boss will introduce his SHADE mechanic.\n\nHe will split into x4 ghost versions of himself and surround the tank.\n\nEACH one of these shades will randomly become solid and attack the tank with a large sweeping aoe hit. Then once it has finished it will vanish and the NEXT one will do it, and so on until there is only ONE left. Then the fight will continue as normal.\n\nThe tricky part...The tank must spot which one is the solid one, AS it changes and then block FACING that particular target. If you are not facing the target and blocking the attack, the attack will go straight through the tank and the aoe hit will cover half of the room, potentially one shotting the group members caught inside.\n\nThe group should stay WAY back at this stage and try to keep damage on the ground for when the boss is appearing.\n\nThe tank needs to block the attacks one after the other after the other in the correct direction (not just hold block) until it is over.\n\nNow while this is a VERY tricky mechanic for even experienced tanks, i have a little bit of a trick for you.\n\nIF you chose to do so instead of fighting the boss in the middle of the room all of the time, you can choose to fight him in the far corner. This means that when the Shade mechanic happens, TWO of the enemies/ghosts are guaranteed to be aiming literally INTO the corner. This means even if something goes wrong, 50% of this mechanic cannot ever physically interact with the group even if the tank misses the block and gets knocked down.\n\nThis will take some practice.\n\n|cffff00Conduit shards|r - At 60% health and lower shards will begin to spawn. These lightning shards drain resources and the more in the room the worse it will get. They spawn in random locations and must be killed immediately! No lazy excuses, get these down! They only have 100k health now so no where near as bad as they used to be but still a major mechanic that must be followed. This will happen continuously for the rest of the fight.\n\n|cffff00Charging Centurion|r - At 40% a new Centurion will start spawning along with the original one. These will chase their target and spin violently causing HUGE damage.\n\nYou have two choices here depending on your group. Kill it fast and get rid of it.\n\nOR get the off tank to taunt it and kite it around the outside of the room in a very wide circle away from the group until it has finished spinning and it will die.\n\nDo NOT panic. This is a simple mechanic and doesn't have to be complicated. Kite  it, or kill it, either option is fine.\n\nEXECUTE: This is the easy part. Basically he has NO enrage. NO execute mechanics, nothing. Everything you have seen to this point is all you will ever see.\n\n40% health and onwards is all the mechanics in the fight. SO, if you can fight at 40% you can fight at 1%, nothing changes.\n\nShards, meteors, upstairs, centurions, ALL the mechanics are still there and nothing changes. So keep doing what you are doing and don't change ANYTHING. If you can get it from 40% to 39% you can get it from 1% to 0%. It's all the same.\n\nI do not recommend people get greedy however and 'go for the nuke'. If you HAVE to go upstairs for many more phases, so be it. It doesn't matter if you have 10k dps or 100k dps, if you can survive the upstairs mechanic, this fight can take as long as it needs to. Play SAFE!\n\n"

This boss is very simple however people do panic too much and make silly mistakes. Can you dps burst this very fast? yes. Do you HAVE to ? NO.\n\nThe is a switch on the wall and it will stun the boss removing it's damage shield. This will sit it down and this is the ONLY time you can damage it. Once it stands up again, it will start walking with a damage shield around it and if you touch it, it will kill you. RUN!\n\nThis is not a fight where the tank gets the aggro, this is a fight where he will just walk and walk until everyone is dead.\n\nEach button you press will knock the spider down BUT it will also make him faster when he gets back up.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - Every phase when the boss stands up and starts walking again, it will spawn two adds. These must be taken away from the boss and killed. Do NOT drop taunts on these guys as they will end up chain pulling the dps/healer players to them and hit VERY hard. Be sure these are facing away from the group else their cleave attacks will kill people in one shot. Also note when the two hander has a damage shield on it, ALL projectile damage types will be reflected back to the player, so careful which abilities you use!\n\nYou can take these adds to one side and kill them before the spider gets to you if you like, OR after the button is pressed the next time, you can put them under the boss while he is stunned and kill them all together. Note however if they are near the boss while he has a damage shield, they will get a massive damage shield too and you will be there fighting them a LONG time and potentially overlap mechanics (more adds).\n\nIF you would like to you CAN actually ignore the button and keep moving and fighting until the adds are dead, build up ultimates, and only press the button when YOU are ready for the fight.\n\n|cffff00Meteors|r - IF for whatever reason you end up TOO far away from the boss, you will be struck with long ranged attacks that will kill the group rapidly. Don't get TOO far away from him and DON'T get behind him, stay in front at all times.\n\n|cffff00Spinning Blades|r - During the fight blades will be moving around and cause HIGH damage both initially and as a damage over time bleed. Do not get caught by these if you can help it. You can block their damage but it will still apply the bleed, but the easiest way is to actually just step out of their way. Remember as demonstrated in the video, the center of any pad shape on the floor is safe, AND you can dodge roll through them to avoid being hit. Apart from that, healers need to be on their A game keeping up those ground based heal over time abilities.\n\n"

Once broken down into sections the fight is very straight forward and actually quite simple. But on the surface can feel a bit crazy.\n\nThere are 3 bosses, the one in the middle will never move, the other two should be split up by two tanks and held so that they are apart in a kind of a triangle formation. They must not be close together because if they are they will link with electrical beams and hit VERY hard. Distance is key here. First i will go over their individual mechanics and then the tactic you should consider applying in order to make life easy for you.\n\n|cffff00Reclaimer|r - This is the middle boss. He will never move so is not a problem however he does have two very specific mechanics.\n- Damage shield: He has a damage shield around him at all times, do not stand in this as it will kill you very fast.\n- Bombers: The boss will spawn slow moving adds, these will walk towards him and if they reach his damage shield they will power up, and charge super fast at a random player and explode. This is a priority mechanic and people MUST kill these. Stop whatever it is you are doing and get these down before they get to the boss. If you are caught by one of these they CAN one shot you, however damage shields, blocking and even a well timed mist form, WILL protect you. So be careful.\n\n|cffff00Reducer|r - This boss should be kept away from the other bosses, as should they all and be held by one of the tanks facing away from the group.\n- Heavy attack: This is a massive hit. The tank must block it or dodge it, but be mindful of you position and don't run around too much.\n- Fire: The boss will swing his sword and launch 3 fast moving fire aoes. These cause huge damage and burn anyone hit by them so watch your feet!\n\n|cffff00Reactor|r - This one is very similar to the Reducer and should be tanked by the second tank away from all other bosses.\n- Heavy attack: This is a massive hit. The tank must block it or dodge it, but be mindful of you position and don't run around too much.\n- Claws: The boss will slam his sword into the ground, when this happens, multiple aoes will appear on the ground and robotic claws will come out of them grabbing anyone that steps in them. Stay out of the claws!\n\n|cffff00Aggro Swap! (tanks)|r - The Reactor and Reducer have a VERY specific mechanic. Bubbles will appear from the tank's perspective from these bosses. When this happens the two tanks need to SWAP these bosses, FAST!... This mechanic will happen throughout the entire fight so look for it, practice it and nail it.\n\nIf you are affected by 10x stacks of the bubble like ability, you will die. If they swap successfully the fight will continue as normal.\n\nHow To Kill it! - Now that you have all of the basic mechanics understood from the above the rest is very simple.\n\nSplit your group into two, one tank, one healer and 4 dps PER boss (left and right) and ignore the middle(you will fight that together anyway).\n\nAt the beginning of the fight hold them all close together and do damage to them collectively until they try to connect with beams.\n\nAs soon as you see this, both tanks should go to opposite sides of the room with their chosen boss. (near the door apart is fine.\n\nFight your bosses and follow the mechanics very clearly. Tanks swap when they need to (just tanks not the group), avoid the fire, the claws, and always ALWAYS kill the bombers.\n\nThis above is basically rinse repeat for the whole fight.\n\nThen at 71ish percent of EACH boss, STOP damage. And get the other to the same amount. When both the reducer and reactor are at about 72% or less you can get the middle one to the same amount.\n\nthe reason for this is because if they hit 69% they will go invulnerable. You want all THREE bosses to hit that invulnerable phase at about the same time.\n\nOnce they are all close to 70-71% (try not to push your luck too early) bring them all together into the middle and drop the house on them. They will all go invulnerable when they hit 69% BUT being close together they will all attach their beams (making them stronger) BUT because they are invulnerable the beam has a negative affect to them. It will STUN them. So now you can do as much aoe damage to them all together as possible before they stand back up again.\n\nOnce they stand up, split them up and go back to your original positions.\n\nIf you can do this ONCE, you already understand the fight and the rest is NO different.\n\nYou repeat this at 3 phases.\n69% (so aim for about 70-71% to start taking control)\n39% (so aim for about 40-41%)\n25% (so aim at about 27% ish).\n\nThe LAST phase, once it is over, split up as usual but you will never be going back to the middle again.\n\nKill the middle boss first to make sure the bomber mechanic never happens again. Then kill the remaining two seperately one after the other while following the original mechanics you are already aware of (fire, claws, swaps etc).People try to make this fight far too complicated, once you can do one phase, you can do it all. Do not get execute panic, there is no enrage just keep doing what you are doing, split them up and finish them off.\n\nTo recap.\n\n71% bring them in, stun them, damage them, split them up,\n41% repeat above\n27% repeat above...\nUnder 25% never come back to the middle finish them one by one, easy right? ;)\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

It is a LONG winded fight, with no real DPS requirements at all, not really even at the end so long as your survival is high and it is just a case of staying calm and focusing on the base mechanics like clockwork (no the mechanism pun was not intended!).\n\nthe tank should stand in front of the boss while the off tank positioning is a bit of a choice depending on the group.\n\nSome people like to have a tank/dps on the spinning blade arm side, to distract it so it doesn't hit the group. Others like to simply use ONE tank and take all the damage upfront while the other stays with the group on the flame arm (under it) controlling adds. The choice is yours.\n\nHowever, the group should sit up on the ledge close to the boss UNDER the flame arm during the main fight and it is pretty straight forward from there, so long as healers are on point.\n\n|cffff00Stomp|r - The boss will stomp one foot knocking the tank back. The boss cannot move towards the tank so if the tank does not get back in range fast enough if knocked back, the boss will get mad and DOUBLE stomp with both feet. If he double stomps with both feet 3 times in the fight, the last one will kill everyone in the group. Do NOT drop taunt or distance yourself too much from the boss as the main tank or this will happen and you won't be able to come back from it.\n\n|cffff00Spinner Blade|r - The right arm of the boss is a spinning blade, this does high fast paced damage and can be agroed by another player standing close to it(if you choose to) or you can take the damage onto the main tank. The reason people tend to kite this is if they are all in front of the boss on the floor(it will attack the group) however since we are on the side under the flame arm, it cannot reach so is not a problem.\n\n|cffff00Flame Arm|r - We have decided to hide UNDER the arm to hit the boss, this does high flame damage over time and needs some heavy heals if you are infront of it however we are under it so we don't take TOO much damage. Be sure your healers are on point and your positioning is very specific. IF you are doing the 'on the floor' tacticmuch like someone kiting the spinner arm, you will need someone to kite this arm but simply staying up on the right side but out of reach of the damage of it (on the corner). However we are not doing that so it should not be an issue for you (knowledge is power though right?).\n\nAt 3% before each recharge phase the arm will fall off. STOP damage at this point and deal with the adds in the room else you will over lap mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - There are multiple adds that spawn in twos. These need to be controlled by the off tank and killed by the group. Now during the killing of the adds we tend to hide around the corner to avoid all of the other incoming nastiness. Stack together, keep the heals coming and keep up survival abilities and ultimates. Don't run around and you will be just fine. (more to follow).\n\nThese adds spawn during set percentages of the fight. They appear at 90%, 87%, 70%, 67%, 50%, 47% and then they will also appear at 30%, 27% but at THAT time they will spawn every 2 mins so be sure to be comfortable to push to the next phase. If at low health you feel like you don't have enough ultimates ready, you are not quite ready to push to execute, perhaps you have some resses to deal with, you CAN hold back and kill another spawn of adds on purpose, as MANY times as you like until you as a group are ready to push to the next phase.\n\n|cffff00Missiles|r - The boss will fire missiles at the group, even more so when you are a long way away (killing adds on the corner). These can be mitigated with spell resistance, damage shields and heals of course, but if you are going too low you CAN block some of the damage. For newer groups I would  recommend that you block these as the stacking damage from multiple aoes landing can be quite bad.\n\n|cffff00Shock aoe|r - There are while upstairs quite a lot of aoes going off, one of which is in the form of shock damage, simply do NOT stand in these if you don't want to die.\n\n|cffff00Claws|r - These you have seen before in the last fight. On the floor there will be aoes with claws in them. Don't stand in them as they will drag you down and do high damage.\n\n|cffff00Recharging|r - At 85%, 65%, 45% the boss will walk off into the middle of the room and recharge. He will gain back his flame thrower and also reflect ALL damage you do. ANYONE that hits the boss will make the boss hit the group with HIGH damage so STOP hitting him!\n\nDuring this time you need to stand together in the middle of the floor avoiding the edges because of the poison damage that will constantly leak through the grills.\n\nThere will be 4x terminals that you have to destroy. One in each corridor section of the room. Each one still alive at the end will enhance the BIG hit he fires at the group when he stands up again. While there ARE x4 of these you only really need to kill TWO.\n\nSo kill the terminal close to you, then run past the boss to another and kill that. Once they are down simply out heal the incoming spinners/meteor/missile damage.\n\nBig damage shields, healing ultimates, protective spells, whatever you have to hand to just stay alive. Do NOT block the spinners, they will destroy your stamina pool in a matter of seconds. Heavy heals stay together and you will be fine.\n\nOnce he stands up, he will pick a location to stand in, you should all (apart from the tank) go up stairs again on his FLAME arm side.\n\nRinse repeat this per phase, if you can do this ONCE, you can do it again. The next phases are NO different. The whole fight is copy and paste.\n\n|cffff00Facsimiles|r - IF anyone dies, an add will appear and take on the form of the class of the player who died. Each death will make one of these appear. Deal with it FAST!\n\nEXECUTE: At 25% the boss will walk into the middle of the room. And this is where positioning is key!!! There is a shaped platform in the middle of the room where he stands with 4x tracks on them. 2 dps should stand on the end of each track (stacked in pairs) (8x people in the middle basically in twos) while the healers and tanks get a corner each leaving enough gap between all players (this is demonstrated in the video at the beginning of the fight.)\n\nWhat this does is this controls the barrage of meteors coming in. They will repeatedly fire at the group individuals hitting 4x players over and over. This can be out healed and i would recommend HIGH damage mitigation skills for this phase.\n\nOnce the boss gets to under 10% the meteors will get faster and hit a further 4x more players. So now the 4 on the outside AND each stack of players on the inside are all taking a meteor each.\n\nIf you do not stack this way there is not enough room for everyone and too much over lapping will happen to early.\n\nBasically during the execute phase, dps players should be doing nothing but their rotations and standing still. While the healers and tanks should keep up as much buff/debuff heals and protective bonuses as possible. Well placed timed novas, barriers, permafrosts, veil of blades etc on rotations (even from the dps) will make this a LOT easier.\n\nNow the true hard facts. This boss doesn't require a 'dps check' in order to complete the execute phase. It requires SURVIVAL. I personally have watched a new group calmly, steadily complete this execute phase with 27k dps BUFFED per person. What they had however was a LOT of protection, they were firing off novas, large damage shields and big heals in aoe consistently. Their survival was so high, it didn't matter how long they took. So, focus, relax, and plug your survival gaps if you have them. If you can live. You can kill it. it doesn't matter if you have 20k dps or 100k dps, so long as you are not dead.\n\nPractice will make all the difference because the more you do it the more comfortable you will be with it. Hardmode is in the video but the only real difference from that to regular vet is the health and a couple more adds. It's not really all that different.\n\nFinal note: don't stand in the poison ;)\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\n"

There are two roles for the tanks here. If you have two tanks, ONE should be focusing the boss keeping it turned away from the group at ALL times. The other tank should be holding the TWO adds to one side faced away from the group.\n\nThe group however should be situated in a semi circle behind Llothis as much as possible to be sure they are not at range OR too far away from the boss. Make sure not to go too close to the two adds unless the group decides they are going to kill them and be aware of incoming mechanics (explained below).\n\n|cffff00Poison Cone|r - Periodically the boss will call out ONE player and aim a very large poison damage over time cone aoe at them. The player effected will have a debuff in their debuff UI and at the same time be glowing green. When this happens the affected player MUST stand completely still and block. All other players must get away from them.\n\nThe reason I encourage people to stay CLOSE to the boss in a semi circle is so that the thin end covers barely any space at all making it very easy for people to avoid it. If you are spread out too far back, the thick end of the cone will cover many players and kill them.\n\nNote: You MUST stand STILL if it is on you, the cone will follow you and if you do not plant your feet you will kill people.\n\n|cffff00Teleport|r - During the fight the boss will teleport to one of 3 locations. When this happens he will leave a very aggressive poison circle on the ground and all players MUST get out of it fast (simply dodge roll). Everyone now needs to reposition to where the boss is now standing and rejoin their semi circle formation ready to play the continuing mechanics.\n\n|cffff00Channel Poison!|r - The boss will raise his hand in the air. When this happens he will have a large burst aoe from under him knocking everyone back and once completed will constantly channel poison damage directly to players. This damage is very high so you MUST pay close attention to this mechanic. The way to stop the WHOLE mechanic, is to spot his action, and simply interrupt it with a bash or interrupting skill.\n\n|cffff00Poison Shot!|r - The boss will occasionally attack the tank (or whoever has agro) with a heavy poison hit which he charges up. This does cause an aoe splash under the tank. If you are the tank simply block this. If you are NOT the tank, you should be no where near the tank and can avoid the aoe with no issue anyway.\n\n|cffff00Enraging Robots!|r - The two adds held to the side by the off tank can either be dealt with or ignored depending on how strong/confident your tank is. A big chunky capable tank can hold them all day long. A squishy one will not. So help them out.\n\nAll you need to do is focus damage on these until they are dead/sat down, and then continue back onto the boss again. If you leave them too long they will enrage. Simple option, kill them or don't. Your group will depend on your choice but either way they MUST be kept facing away from the group.\n\nBoth have a frontal aoe attack which can wipe individuals if not a tank, and they have a hovering STOMP which can one shot dps and/or healers Especially when enraged. To play safe, kill them when ever they are active. But again the choice is yours. In the video we played safe. They don't have a lot of health, aoe can kill them easy.\n\n"

This is an endurance test for consistency. It doesn't have to be a long fight but your mechanics and co-ordination must be on point if not to scatter aoes all over the place.\n\nThe tank should hold the boss with their back against the wall in the middle, while the group stand together in a solid hard stack in the center of the circle the tank is near. 3 people need to be on the edges of the room however.\n\nEither healers or ranged dps for two of them, and the off tank for the other (as demonstrated in the middle) one left one right and one middle. These are bait for the boss as he will jump to them during the fight. More explained below.\n\n|cffff00BIG BOOM!|r - Yes these abilities have real names but you KNOW which mechanic i am talking about if you are reading this. Saint Felms will raise his hand and release TWO energy orbs into the air and they will come crashing down on the group. Much like world shaper in Sanctum Ophidia. This boss has already decided which target/s are going to be aimed at. So if someone is running around these boom mechanics can land in some really messed up places. So you MUST at ALL times, for THIS mechanic, stay as hard stacked as you can. Doing this will always push those shots to land in a double stack rather than spread out, in the middle of the group.\n\nNow the hard part. Before it lands, the whole group needs to sprint out of the middle. Let them explode and then(the hardest part) get back IN AGAIN!! As stupid as that sounds that is quite possibly the hardest part to get right. There is ALWAYS that 'one person' who will NOT co-ordinate and thinks their new position is safe and they can do what they wantWRONG. Get out, get in, get out, get in. Very simple. Do not mess it up because you will be one shot for it and it is hard to recover. This trial is all about co-ordination and it is not the mechanics that will necessarily kill youit is your friends ;)\n\n|cffff00Teleport|r - The boss during the fight will teleport strike. This i why you need the three kiters. At 100% and under he will jump to ONE target. Drop a BIG damage overtime aoe affect on the floor with minor maim attatched to it (this will reduce damage the players do if they are hit with it) when he teleports to the player, they must block and/or dodge roll and get out of the placed circle and stand in a new spot (equally as far away from the boss kill spot if possible. Once he jumps again the old aoe will be gone and they can go back to their original position. Back and forth basically baiting the boss out. At 75% the boss will start doing this to TWO players and finally at 50% he will do it to THREE players (hence 3 kiters). There are many different ways to do this but it IS a solid method and you can see in the video how to pull this off. If you maintain this you will always have the Maim circles on the ground OUTSIDE the group while the BIG BOOM mechanic will always be in control with plenty of space in the middle.\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - Throughout the fight 2 shadows will appear together. These need to be stacked with the boss and you MUST focus them. The lower the health in the fight the more damage they do and they CAN wipe the group especially at 25% and under. Your priority targets in this fight are THOSE adds. It doesn't matter how long it takes you to kill the boss so long as you focus the adds.\n\nOne major thing to note is to watch out for their spin to win (whirlwind). If they spin they will show a large aoe. You can step out of this if you are fast but if not, you MUST block or you will most of the time, die.\n\nIn a nut shell, kiters hold your nerve and focus, main group get in get out as the big boom comes in and kill adds. Tankdon't die! Strict co-ordination and understanding of the 3 major mechanics and this can be an easy ride. Scattering complacency will make this a mess.\n\n"

Some of his mechanics can cause a FAST wipe so you MUST pa attention. Generally it is not the mechanics that kill youbut your own TEAM running around like...you guessed it, 'headless chickens'.\n\nThe boss should be held to one side of the room and faced away from the group. While the group situated themselves in a strict semi circle behind the boss.\n\nOne healer should be at the back behind the tank and one should be behind the main force of the group (this will make more sense later).\n\nBe sure that you have noted the gate and the fence (or back and front) of the room so that you know that place is a safe zone for a later JUMP mechanic. This is all demonstrated also in the video. No it is NOT 'entrance and exit'the exit is the front door, if you exit out of the back fence you mite hurt yourself in the face! Jokes aside call it what you must in order to understand your location/spacial awareness in the room. But these are important spots to remember for later.\n\n|cffff00Steam breath|r - The tank will occasionally have a MASSIVE cone aoe aimed at them where the boss is literally breathing in their face. This will apply a very long duration debuff and while on you, you will take a LOT of damage from all other attacks. Instead of receiving the damage, simply step to one side, let it pass and then get back into position again. You do NOT have to be hit by this. The boss is incredibly slow you have loads of time.\n\n|cffff00Heavy Attack|r - This is pretty simple. The boss will heavy attack the tank. block it!\n\n|cffff00Lighting Tail Whip|r - Be careful with the boss, if you spin him and the person with agro is BEHIND the boss, he will try to tail while you and several split up lightning shots will be fired at you across the floor. If you do not block this you will be stunned.\n\n|cffff00Lighting Circle|r - Saint Olms will spit into the air roughly once every 30-32 seconds firing a lightning circle on the ground at the FURTHEST away target. The back kiter or the front kiter will receive this unless  dps is not paying attention. Don't let this happen too often, kiters are there for a reason, pay attention. When it lands the kiter will have get out of it quick and stand to the side of it ready for the next one to land or simply wait out it's duration.\n\nIf you stand in it you will lose health rapidly and lose 50% resources per tick. So you really don't want to be in there. the kiter behind the tank has several cubby holes they can stand in to bait out the aoe. Once it lands all the have to do is move to the next one and rinse repeat.\n\nTIP: If you are scared, unsure, inexperienced or just want the help. Slot mist form. You basically just walk out of it with that buff on and protect yourself MUCH easier rather than taking a one shot for making silly mistakes.\n\n|cffff00JUMP!|r - At set health percentages (yes these can overlap if the boss is in a rotation and you do more damage) he will jump back and forth to the left and the right of the room over and over. This is when your group in the middle AND the BACK kiter will need to go to their closest safe spot (front or back of the room). Once there they must BLOCK. Doing so will protect them vs the big quake he affects each player with. If not you will die. You can survive with damage shields and such but just keep it simple for now, keep health up and block!\n\nIf the kiter does not get in place quickly by the way they are the first to die because his first jump location (right) is exactly where they are standing. The tank however can block the whole hit when he jumps on their head no problem.\n\nOnce the phase is over he will be back in position and you can continue the fight. This jump phase will happen at 91% 76% 51% and 26% so pay attention to the health and be ready to make a run early on!\n\n|cffff00Protectors|r - Tiny Drewmer roller drones will appear and come into the room. These are 100% your priority target for the entire fight. They situate in many different places at random and must be killed. If they are alive the boss is invulnerable. But you MUST be sure to maintain your semi circle formation as much as or as soon as possible if you feel like you need to move. The safest way is to let the people closest deal with it and you can just heavy attack the boss to get resources back during this phase if you cannot reach (if you need to) or if you HAVE ranged damage available, try to kill it from as far away as possible so your position in the semi circle is not compromised for longthe next mechanic is incredible important for that!\n\n|cffff00FAN OUT!|r - The boss will flap his wings and life OFF the ground into the air trying to be a real bird but looking like the robot chicken he is! When this happens, he will throw out some straight ground based electrical shots which must be avoided in several directions and at the same timesomeone needs to shout 'FAN OUT!'because that is exactly what you are about to do.\n\nEach player will be effected by a lightning aoe that they will drop on the floor. If they stay still it will hit them and kill them. If they move it will be dropped on the floor away from them. This will happen with 4 individual aoe drops per person. SO, you are already in a semi circleso if everyone walks back wards!  NO ONE will cross ANYONE'S path and everyone will have loads of room either side of them. All you have to do, is go back back back, come back in. It's very simple.\n\nNO ONE should be overlapping, NO one should be standing behind anyone else and NO one should be dancing around the room.\n\nIn some situations you are in a tight squeeze so you can go in a small circle/square and drop them near you but do NOT interact with other players.\n\nMuch like the first boss, every body get out, every body get in again. This is the simplest mechanic in the entire trial and the one that kills EVERYONE because of that 'one person' that won't stick to their position. This WILL take some practice but once you nail it is can be very straight forward.\n\nThe key point is to ALWAYS maintain your semi circle position not stacking on anyone not standing in front or behind anyone and then this mechanic is done.\n\nThis will happen once every 60seconds or so , so keep your eyes peeled! And above all do NOT panic.\n\n|cffff00Fire Pot Spiders|r - During the fight these are running around like mad going into the group and blowing up. Don't panic, don't even taunt them just keep dots down and they will die. Failing that they will explode eventually anyway so just watch your feet. So long as you are not REALLY low health they shouldn't cause much of a problem.\n\nThe Room, The Room, The room is on FIRE! - At 25% health the boss introduces his FINAL mechanic. The easiest and most dramatic mechanic of the entire trial! NO it is NOT panic time It is NOT 'enrage time' there is no enrage!\n\nThe boss will glow orange and spit into the air. The left side will be consumed in fire (meteor type spreading fire) the tank and healer must block and then cleanse/heal the 4 second damage over time they receive.\n\nIf you are standing in your semi circle, this POP will NEVER hit the group. Panic over. On the right side of the room, another spreading boom of death will appearif you are in the semi circle you will also NEVER be hit by thisthe back kiter may need to move forward slightly for a split second...\n\nAnd the final boom! In the middle ISHIF you maintain your positions and IF you are disciplined through all of the mechanics, you should be roughly in the middle of the room, which puts you on the edge of EITHER or the two random incoming aoes. Making it much easier to simply step out of it. So to make that clearer. The big boom will cover as much ground as the other two shots but it WON'T be dead center, it will be at the front of the room, or the back. All you need to know is where it is landing, and simply run to the gap. Once successful, run back into your spot and carry on like nothing happened.\n\nTIP: if this mechanic keeps tripping you up over and over and over, take off a dps skill (if you are a dps) and slot mist form. From full health IF you accidentally get caught, pop a mistform, and stand in the fire. You will take barely any damage at all. You can maintain mistform until your damage over time ability is off you, OR you can insta remove the skill channel and take a heal/purge. NICE and easy and GREAT for practicing and building confidence in that part of the fight!\n\nFrom there on out all of the above mechanics are rinse repeat! Maintain co-ordination throughout and you are fine. It is not a dps race it is an endurance consistency test. Don't be complacent, work as a team and don't Kill each other!\n\n\n\n|cffff00HARDMODE!!!!|r\n\n\n\nEssentially there are 2 different Types or stages of hard modes. One type, you basically take on Saint Olms and ONE of hits side bosses. Either Flelms OR Llothis. The way to do this is to kill the one you Don't want in the room, ignore the other one and come back down stairs and open the gate.\n\nThe other way is to fight them all at once! This is simple. Don't bother going up the ramps. Just run straight to the gate and open it.\n\nThe ENTIRE BOSS FIGHT is EXACTLY the same. ZERO new mechanics, howevernow you have to deal with his minions and these do make a big difference.\n\n|cffff00Llothis|r - Llothis will enter the room after the first Jump (90-91%). You now have a 10million health version of Llothis and all of his mechanics to deal with. He will teleport around the room leaving poison dots. He will do the poison cone which people MUST block and stand still with and he will cast his channel ability which MUST be interrupted!\n\nIf you can manage these mechanics, you have one major condition as well as controlling the boss and mechanicsYou need to sit him DOWN! He has 10million health and you have 3 minutes to kill him (sit him down) until he enrages. You can survive and still maintain if he enrages if your group is built for survival but really just push him as much as you can to stop that from happening.\n\nSo there technically is a dps check for this guy BUT it is VERY low. During mechanics though panic can alter how this pans out for the group. 3 minutes of 10million health is literally only 7k dps per player 'required'But it is very easy to get overwhelmed with mechanics and slip. So do focus mechanics but also focus your damage on THIS guy.\n\nIf the off tank can manage it, try to stack him on St Olms so that aoe can still hit the boss while you aim to focus Llothis. Be aware though, you must still make Protectors and mechanics your main priority.\n\nOnce Lothis sits down, you have 45 seconds of free time until he gets back up again at full health.\n\nRinse repeat.\n\n|cffff00Felms|r - Felms will come in at the second jump (75-76%). Now you have both bosses in the room. This boss follows the same rules. 10mil health, 3min timer before enrage and of course 45 seconds sit down once he is dead before he comes back in again.\n\nTry to apply the same strategy with this boss as the other. Get the off tank to try to stack it on or close to the boss IF possible so that aoe can hit the boss and this guy can be focused.\n\nIf ONE of the minis is up, be sure to focus them. If BOTH are up, try to kill them as close together as possible so then you have 45 seconds breathing space with BOTH sat down. This will take practice.\n\nDuring his presence in the room he will NOT have adds, but he will have his teleport mechanic dropping the maim circle, which is why it is important for the group's position to be disciplined and for the back of the room kiter to always be in position to receive it as and when they can (demonstrated in the video, be sure to block/dodge). And, he will also have his big boom mechanic aimed at individuals. If you see it coming, just step out of it.\n\nOverall it is about pace. Relax, be co-ordinated and don't panic. The dps requirement for these two bosses are unbelievably low but complacency can waste a LOT of time. Focus as a team and this can be a breeze, panic and this can be a long day at the office!\n\nOverall you must maintain order of priority. Protectors MUST die first (one protector out makes Saint Olms, if two are out the mini is immune, if three are out they are ALL immune. After the protectors the mini bosses take priority, and the boss is always your last target. If you are playing wack-a-mole with the mini adds but doing even 1k dps to the boss over a long period of time, so long as you are keeping those mini bosses from enraging, you are still going to pass.\n\nSaint Olms does NOT have a dps check. Just manage the adds and pace it.\n\npractice makes perfect, you can do it! ;) get out as the big boom comes in and kill adds. Tankdon't die! Strict co-ordination and understanding of the 3 major mechanics and this can be an easy ride. Scattering complacency will make this a mess.\n\n"

The tank should turn it away from the group at all times while maintaining a static possition where possible. Running around the room will make this messy very quickly. So hold your ground as a tank unless you are avoiding standing in stupid.\n\nThe DPS and Healer should be behind the boss and stand where ever is safe. Be sure to NOT run around the room in circles as the boss does NOT like it and people will suffer from it.\n\n|cffff00Bite/Fire Balls|r - The boss hit with basic bite attacks but while at range will spit fire balls instead. Block these if they hit you but should really ONLY be on the tank. So a taunt MUST be maintained.\n\n|cffff00Fire Breath|r - This is pretty self explanatory, the boss breathes fire in the direction of the tank or whoever has the aggro at the time. Don't stand in this. If you are the tank you can block it, but it does hit pretty hard.\n\n|cffff00Fire puddles|r - The boss will spit fire into the air and it will land in many different places on the floor. usually aimed at people directly so when these attacks happen, be sure to step out of them. They will remain burning on the floor and take up a lot of space. Do NOT stand in them!\n\n|cffff00Big BOOM!|r - The boss will STOMP on the ground. When this happens ALL Fire AOE puddles on the ground will explode. If you are standing inside one when they go boom, you die! Don't stand in them!\n\n|cffff00PIN/Charge|r - The boss will occasionally charge at a member of the group to knock them down. Usually the furthest away. If you are charged at be sure to block.\n\nOccasionally however this is not just a charge but a FULL knock down pin. The boss will continuously bite on the player until they are dead. You MUST help by interrupting the boss to get them off your team mate before they are killed!\n\n|cffff00Adds|r - After 75% the boss will occasionally howl. When this happens, multiple mini dogs will come into the fight. The tank should pull these in and control them while the group kill them. Be sure to get rid of the adds so you are not overwhelmed. If you are dps/healer and you have aggro of these do NOT run around the room, try to maintain your composure and keep doing what you are doing, block if necessary while the tank gains aggro on them. Running around makes you susceptible to the charge mechanic more often due to your distance form the boss.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 BLOOD TWILIGHT |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is very simple in terms of mechanics but it is very easy to make a mess of it if people panic. If you are following mechanics rather than 'nuke it or go home' there are some very simple rules to follow. The simplest way to tank the boss is to drag it into a corner and face it against the wall. Then the dps/healers should stand behind the boss at all times.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will disappear and then jump in on the tank with a heavy attack, much like the Shadow Strike type ability most Twilights do, including the bosses from Maw of Lorkhaj and Imperial City Prison. The tank simply needs to block this.\n\n|cffff00Machine Gun|r - This barrage of damage is the same as lord warden. He will fire multiple magical attacks like a machine gun and the tank needs to block this/stand in front of it until it is over. Absorption skills also work.\n\n|cffff00Imps|r - Four Imps will spawn around the room. The tank can pull these in OR the group can go off and individually kill them, but either way you want them dead. While they are alive the boss will be buffed and hit harder.\n\n|cffff00Blood phase|r - After the Imps have spawned, the boss will teleport into the middle of the room. He will be immune to damage and the group must stay OUT of the blood or die. Pull the boss back to the original position once the phase is over.\n\nHowever during this phase an add will spawn (see below) and also multiple ghost/spirit type reflections of the boss will appear and suddenly wing slap the group.\n\nThis is a very simple mechanic. BLOCK it, or get thrown into the middle.\n\nOnce the phase is over, simply carry on as normal.\n\n|cffff00Reanimated Vampire|r - During the Blood phase as well as having to block the wing slaps, you will have this add spawn. The tank must taunt it and turn it away from the group as it has some rather heavy hitting cleave attacks with his two hander weapon. This is now your primary target.\n\nKill this add with full focus on it, even if the boss blood phase is over and now back in the fight, you MUST focus this add. Getting overwhelmed with multiples will make a mess.\n\nThe rest of the fight is rinse repeat with NO enrage mechanics.\n\nIf you can do one phase, completion is inevitable because the rest are the same. It's repetitive.\n\n"

If you don't work well as a team this can get messy fast! You have already seen most of the major mechanics if you have gotten this far so you should be fine, but this is where it all gets put together at once.\n\nThe tank should maintain a taunt, hold the boss still and turn it away from the group at ALL times.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will attack whoever has aggro (should be the tank) with a huge swing of his Scythe. The tank MUST block this. If you are a dps/healer and this is going to hit you, dodge roll it. You won't live trying to block this as it is designed for a tanky character with block mitigation bonuses.\n\n|cffff00Swarm|r -  During the fight the boss will select a target and a swarm of crows will chase them. This circle AOE will cause HIGH damage if caught inside of it. The player effected should take it out of the group and kite it around the room in a safe place until it is over.\n\n|cffff00Scythe throw|r - at 75% 50% and 25% the boss with throw his Scythe across the room and it will draw in ALL players. Each player will have an aoe under their feet with a rapid timer on it before it explodes. When this happens you MUST co-ordinate as a group and agree who is going where! Basically spread out ASAP so that NO ONE overlaps. If you are all safe, the explosion will go off and you can continue as normal. If anyone overlaps, they will die!\n\nNOTE: After this you can attack the Scythe and then throw it at one of the hanging bodies to release some mini pets to help you in the fight.\n\n|cffff00Reanimated Vampire|r - After each throw phase the boss will spawn a Reanimated Vampire, much like the one in the previous boss fight. The mechanics are exactly the same and you MUST focus it. If you do not prioritize this target and you end up with multiple by over burning the boss and not the add, you will be in some serious trouble as these hit very hard.\n\n|cffff00Summoned goo!|r - Periodically throughout the fight the boss will also summon a purple ball of goo. It will attack players from range. Be sure to kill this as soon as you can. And continue on the boss once it is dead.\n\nKEY points: Co-ordinate with the split mechanic, an always focus adds over the boss.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 TALFYG |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is simple if you apply basic mechanics and awareness. But if can be hell if not. The tank should hold the boss at ALL times as still as possible unless they HAVE to move. This is a simple, 'hit the boss, hit the adds, back to the boss again' fight. Not hard really in essence but some mechanics will wipe the group quickly. So pay close attention.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will throw out a occasionally at the tank. Simply block this and you will be fine.\n\n|cffff00Ground pound|r - The boss will occasionally smash the ground leaving a large aoe on the ground. You can block this as the tank but be sure once it has landed that you step out of it. DPS/Healers do not want to be anywhere near this!\n\n|cffff00Gargoyles|r - Through0ut the fight the gargoyles from the sides of the room will spawn and slowly walk towards the boss. They hit pretty hard and have nasty growing AOE damage around them. be sure to focus these down as soon as they awaken. If you leave them to come join the main fight then the tank will get overwhelmed with a LOT of damage and it just makes a mess.\n\nGet off the boss, kill the awakened gargoyles, then get back on the boss again. Simple focus based mechanics of prioritizing targets.\n\n|cffff00BEAM!|r - The boss will aim a beam of damage with a ground based aoe attached to it. The tank can block this or simply step out of it.\n\n|cffff00GROUP BEAM!|r - At LOW health (after all of the gargoyles have been awakened and the boss is approaching low health) the boss will raise his hand in the air. When this happens the entire group needs to split up and go different directions to kite the beam away until it is over. Once the mechanic has finished, come back in and fight the boss again. IF you fail this you will die. It does massive damage, don't get caught (demonstrated in the video).\n\nThis mechanic at low health will repeat over and over until the boss is dead so pay attention to his actions.\n\n"

					mechanic = "|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t|cffff00 LADY THORN |r|t24:24:xynode/icons/xynode_boss_over.dds|t\n\nThis boss is very simple BUT hit's like a truck. So there are some CLEAR mechanics that you MUST pay attention. The tank should hold the boss as still as possible at all times while the group stays relatively CLOSE but behind her. If you spread out too much too often she will make things very difficult.\n\n|cffff00Heavy attack|r - The boss will heavy attack the tank, this is a BIG hitting ability and MUST be blocked. no block = dead tank, you WON'T survive.\n\n|cffff00Bombs|r - The boss The boss will cast multiple bomb type aoes on the ground. Step out, get away from them, come back in again. nice and simple, don't mess it up or they will kill you fast!\n\n|cffff00Bat Swam|r - The boss will disappear leaving a HUGE aoe on the ground of swarming bats. If you TOUCH this you will die. In the mean time, multiple smaller swarms will shoot OUT from it and then com back in again. Do not let any of these touch you as you will take HUGE damage. And in the mean time 3x small zombies will appear. Simply kill these and then carry on as normal.\n\nNote: When the phase is over she will spawn on a player of her choice with a LARGE aoe burst on the ground. Get out of this and don't let it hit you or you will die (70k+ damage in one hit).\n\n|cffff00Teleport punch|r - This mechanic is simple but fast. She will dash across the floor and hit one player of her choice (usually the furthest away but not always so stay close and maintain your positions). If it is YOU she is aiming at. You have two choices. BLOCK/DODGE and livedon't and DIE!\n\n|cffff00In the Light!|r - At 60% and at 20% the boss will be immune and a big circular light aoe will appear. The rest of the Room is a bat swarm. If you stay in the bat swarm you will die, if you stay in the light you will live.\n\nWhile in the circle it will move around and you must stay with it, but the boss will charge at the group. You can dodge this attack or block it, but if you are HIT you will be stunned/knocked down and have to break free.\n\nDuring this entire phase, periodically a Guardian add will spawn. This must be killed and interrupted occasionally to avoid it's channeled attack. And the tank must maintain aggro of it. Make this target your main focus, it MUST die, you don't want multiples.\n\nAlso during this phase SCAMPS will spawn. These are very low health but when they die they drop a synergy on the ground.\n\nTake the synergy 4x and the boss will come down and you can continue the fight as normal (the phase is over).\n\nNOTE: The synergy will allow you immunity to the bats for a couple of seconds if you run out and grab it but be sure to get back in the light fast.\n\nAlso note, on hard mode you will have multiple Zombies in the room too.\n\nOnce the phase is over it is rinse repeat until 20% and then rinse repeat until dead. There is NO enrage and NO dps check.\n\n|cffff00Hardmode Execute phase|r - After the second light phase at 20% is over. The room will REMAIN in darkness. The light will remain also! Now you must fight the boss, while on the move! She will have her BASIC mechanics and bombs.\n\nNo dps check, no enrage, just watch your feet and kill her.\n\nGOOD LUCK!\n\n"

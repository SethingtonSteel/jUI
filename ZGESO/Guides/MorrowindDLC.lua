kill Bahlokdaan
|tip This is a pretty tricky fight, but it has a pattern that is reasonably easy to follow. First, you'll need a ranged weapon. It's almost impossible to try and melee the dragon as it does a lot of damage in one melee hit. The trick is to use the walls in the courtyard to block various incoming telegraphs like fire breath and shouts (e.g., Skyrim stuff). When the dragon teleports you to its location immediately run back behind the wall. The best strategy to use is to strafe back and forth between two walls while firing at the dragon from the opening all-the-while paying attention to which telegraph the dragon uses. Depending on your range DPS this could take a while. But follow the pattern, and you'll bring the big guy down.

|tip Cadwell is another of Northern Elsweyr's seminal bosses and as such presents quite a challenge. You'll want to use a health-augmenting consumable before the fight and keep your health potions on the ready. Cadwell hits like a freight truck. Further, he casts an array of AOE telegraphs that spread out from his location like a pinwheel. At particular intervals, he'll cast a large AOE telegraph at your location. Standing in it will stun you and do lots of damage. However, you can easily avoid it if you listen for his "taste of oblivion" cry. In a group is the most efficient way to tackle Cadwell. However, if you're solo, ranged attacks are the best choice. The excellent news is excluding one ability in which Cadwell teleports to you most of the time he'll waste his time running around the room. So as long as you keep your distance, you can kill the ole chap. Jolly good and some such!

kill Lieutenant Herennius
kill Lieutenant Artorius
|tip Defeat a couple of waves of easy incoming Euraxian enemies. When both lieutenants appear, the best tactic is to move around using AOE attacks to kill Herennius as soon as possible. While inflicting damage you'll want to avoid her multiple summoned Atronachs, and once dispatched, finish off Artorius. Herennius's Atronachs don't have much health so they'll die fairly quickly. Try and stay inside Abnur Tharn's energy shield as much as possible. Use any health augmenting potions you have available and keep health potions on the ready as needed.

kill Mulaamnir
|tip This is the expansion's dragon fight in all its glory and as such it will be difficult in the extreme. Ranged is the best attack for the fight, and being in a group is the best tactic. However, it is more likely you'll do it solo so if you have any health augmenting potions, you should consume one. Keep your healing potions on the ready. You'll likely need several resurrection gems and if you don't have a few, get them. The fight is divided up into three phases that repeat in sequence.
|tip PHASE 1: Mulaamnir spits dragon fire and teleports you to his location until he reaches a certain health percentage. Immediately after he teleports you, run away as his melees can one-shot you much like Bahlokdaan could in Riverhold. You'll want to use either pillar in the back to block some of Mulaamnir's more deadlier dragon fire. However, it is okay to run up the stairs and duck behind a wall. The primary consideration is to keep away from the dragon's melee attack range. 
|tip PHASE 2: Mulaamnir takes flight and summons various Atronachs and minions. During one of the later stages, he'll summon a couple of elite Atronachs including multiple lower leveled minions. The key here is to AOE them all down while avoiding the dragon's telegraphing attacks from above.
|tip PHASE 3: Run into Abnur Tharn's energy shield to protect from Mulaamnir's shout and immediately after use the Dragonhorn. After this, the dragon will return to phase 1. That's the extent of the fight.
